The alternative to a shooting war would be a cold war, or, as it is preferred to be called today, a hybrid war. A hybrid war engages elements of finance, trade, psychology, information technology, cyber attacks, special forces against the enemy, but it does not give the rulers the authority to use command methods on the economy. And this is necessary for overcoming the dis-balances of the economy. And here comes the coronavirus. The rulers started to blow up a threat, create an atmosphere of fear. Using the panic, the authorities are given unlimited powers and start actively to interfere in the economy.",

On the night of March 22-23, the Georgian side, with the active support of the EU Monitoring Mission (EUMM), used three balloons and one light UAV to conduct optical reconnaissance over the South Ossetian territory, positions of the South Ossetian KGB and border patrols of Russian FSB. While Russia provides humanitarian and medical assistance to Italy in the fight against the coronavirus, the EUMM, with its mandate, actually covers up the irresponsible activities of the Georgian security forces, which aim to complicate the functioning of the state border between South Ossetia and Georgia and create additional security threats.",

Likewise, the suspicions \u201cpublished by Russia\u201d about America\u2019s role in the Corona issue can only be considered a campaign of misleading public opinion, as is understood from the report. However, a question arises here: Why have not all the 80 such cases been widely published, especially as Russia is \u201ctrying to spread the atmosphere of terror among European societies\u201d and \u201cspreading division\u201d as the European Union claims? Do not such matters affect European national security in the eyes of Europeans? It is always possible to invent anything when facts are not available. In this case the evidence is not necessary, but it is sufficient to put a \u201chighly confidential\u201d stamp and refer to high-level sources. Those who practice this will keep it a secret if they have nothing to offer. The reason is the absence of evidence and facts, that is, they have nothing to say \u2026 so simply.",

It is simply not true that the EU has not published the Russian media cases of disinformation. As of 19 March, our database has collected and published over 110 corona-related disinformation cases in the public EUvsDisinfo database since 22 January 2020. These messages are characteristic of the Kremlin\u2019s well-established strategy of using disinformation to amplify divisions, sow distrust and chaos, and exacerbate crisis situations and issues of public concern. Here is a summary of the main disinformation messages Russian media (including official media) has been spreading about the coronavirus: Messages targeting domestic Russian audiences describe the virus as a form of foreign aggression, for instance claiming that the coronavirus originates in secret US or Western laboratories and emphasising that challenges coping with the virus mainly affect foreign and democratic countries, while Russia is fighting the outbreak. \u2022 Messages targeting international audiences (in English, Italian, Spanish and Arabic, among other languages) follow a different approach: they focus primarily on conspiracy theories about \u201cglobal elites\u201d deliberately weaponising or exploiting the virus for their own ends. Here the aim is to induce distrust in national and European authorities and healthcare systems, international institutions, and scientific experts, among others. \u2022 Narratives describing the virus as man-made is present in disinformation targeting all audiences.",

The European Union is supporting the Member States in addressing the crisis, and mitigating the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. To cushion the blow to people\u2019s livelihoods and the economy, the European Commission has adopted a comprehensive economic response to the outbreak, applied the full\u00a0flexibility of the EU fiscal rules, has revised its\u00a0State Aid rules and proposed to set up a EUR 37 billion\u00a0Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative to provide liquidity to small businesses and the health care sector. To support scientific research into the COVID-19, the European Commission earmarked 47,5 million EUR for shortlisted research projects that can improve epidemiology and public health, including preparedness and response to outbreaks. The EU has also created first ever stockpile of medical equipment.\u00a0 Read more about the EU's response here and here.\u00a0 There are also examples of EU Member States helping each other in times of crisis, for example German hospitals offering to treat critical coronavirus patients from France.\u00a0 Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, the U.S. Army has taken a number of precautionary measures to reduce the unnecessary spread of the disease, including scaling down the U.S.-led multinational Exercise 'Defender Europe 20'. However the Alliance\u2019s essential work continues and NATO\u2019s ability to conduct operations remains intact.",

If Germany starts saving the EU too enthusiastically, social pressures within the country will lead to the regime change. There is no sense for Germany to remain in the EU as well, it is only beneficial for poor countries. If Italy receives a lot of money from the EU, then it is worth for it to stay it, but is it worth for Germany to drag Italy on its shoulders?",

            "content": "Conspiracy theory with no evidence given. One of many recurring Kremlin disinformation narratives claiming that the outbreak of\u00a0COVID-19 coronavirus is man-made. COVID-19 is not a biological weapon. A recent analysis of the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 virus found no evidence that it was developed artificially in a lab or otherwise engineered. The virus comes from a family of viruses originating in animals that include other viruses such as SARS and MERS. It was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in central China and has been rapidly spreading across the world. The number of COVID-19 cases surpassed 300,000 globally with over 14,000 deaths by 23 March 2020. Cases have been reported in 190 countries, territories and areas. Many other claims have been pushed by pro-Kremlin media since the outbreak started in January 2020, for example, that COVID-19 is a biological weapon to make the planet's population infertile, that it was\u00a0born in a laboratory to infect the Chinese, that it is an element of hybrid warfare and that it is a pretext to introduce tyranny by the ruling class. This case is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about socio-economic degradation in the Baltic States as opposed to their alleged well-being under the USSR and EU's imminent collapse due to coronavirus epidemic. In fact, the economic situation of all three Baltic States is strong and demonstrates some of the leading economic growth indicators in the EU. The dynamics over the past years are available here.

The narrative of \u00a0\u201cimminent collapse\u201d \u00a0is one of the core instruments of pro-Kremlin disinformation outlets, used to spread demoralisation and self-doubt among target audiences, as well as to sow discord, panic and diminish trust in national authorities, the EU and international institutions. The article provides no evidence to support its apocalyptic claims about the imminent collapse of global order and the breakdown of globalisation. The COVID-19 pandemic is halting travel and commerce across the globe. Its spread will slow the global economy which is heavily dependent on international production and global supply chains. While the pandemic is a challenge for globalization, it will not bring the end to this long-term process. Globalisation has brought significant benefits for billions of people, and most of the world will not be eager to do away with these benefits and with the free movement of people, goods and capital. COVID-19, as well as future pandemics, can only be countered by means of international cooperation.\u00a0 A coordinated, cross-border effort to monitor and treat the disease, and to speedily develop and disseminate a vaccine across national borders, will end the pandemic. Both the COVID-19 epidemic and the resulting economic crisis are global threats. They can be countered effectively only by means of global cooperation. Read here a previous case claiming that the coronavirus represents the end of globalisation.",

Authoritarian regimes, which tend to control and manipulate information and to limit the freedom of doctors and scientists to engage in international cooperation, are often an obstacle to the timely detection and containment of epidemic outbreaks. A clear example is China\u2019s deliberate cover-up of the early days of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan. The regime suppressed information about the virus and allowed it to spread unchecked in the crucial early days and weeks. The Chinese government censored and detained those doctors and whistleblowers who attempted to sound the alarm and warn their fellow citizens when they understood the gravity of the coronavirus threat. Furthermore, the real antidote to the coronavirus pandemic (and to future epidemic outbreaks) is not to revert to nationalist isolationism and \u201cclosed societies\u201d but to develop a global response. A coordinated, cross-border effort of the scientific and medical community to\u00a0 understand the virus, create cures and treatments, and speedily disseminate a vaccine across national borders, will end the pandemic.

As a result, thousands died, the economy crashed, and a good Europe\u2019s image with it. Europe started copying the Chinese experience of combatting the pandemic and accepted humanitarian assistance from Russia, Cuba, Egypt, and China.

The European Union is supporting the Member States in addressing the crisis and mitigating the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. To cushion the blow to people\u2019s livelihoods and the economy, the European Commission has adopted a comprehensive economic response to the outbreak, applied the full flexibility of the EU fiscal rules, has revised its State Aid rules and proposed to set up a EUR 37 billion Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative to provide liquidity to small businesses and the health care sector. To support scientific research into the COVID-19, the European Commission earmarked 47,5 million EUR for shortlisted research projects that can improve epidemiology and public health, including preparedness and response to outbreaks. The EU has also created the first-ever stockpile of medical equipment. Read more about the EU's response here and here.

There is no evidence that NATO was planning to deploy weapons system in Crimea, which was part of a sovereign Ukraine. NATO expansion is also a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative. NATO does not \"expand\" in the imperialistic sense described by the Kremlin leadership and Russian state media, but instead considers the applications of candidate countries that want to join the defensive alliance based on their own national will. NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia. The claim that NATO was planning to base ships and missiles in Crimea is fiction.\u00a0The idea has never been proposed, suggested or discussed within NATO.\u00a0In the\u00a0Statement\u00a0by the North Atlantic Council on Crimea on 18 March 2019, NATO condemned Russia's ongoing and wide-ranging military build-up in Crimea, and expressed concern by Russia's efforts and stated plans for a further military build-up in the Black Sea region. Here are another cases claiming that Crimea was supposed to become a NATO base, or Crimean population was always eager to reconnect with their Russian homeland, or \"one of the main goals, why Maidan was conceived: to have a NATO base in Crimea\", Crimea reconnected with Russia to avoid NATO troops.

The narrative that the \"Chernobyl cloud stopped at the French borders\" is so well spread in France that is accepted as a clich\u00e9. In the early days after the nuclear accident, in April 1986 not 1984 as stated on Sputnik, environmental associations and journalists spread the idea that the French Minister of Health or Pierre Pellerin, the Director of the Central Service for Protection against Ionising Radiation, said that the \"cloud stopped at the French borders\". This statement was never made. Pierre Pellerin won several defamation cases against NGOs and Media on this matter.\u00a0Newspapers such as Le Parisien or Le Point admitted their mistake and explained how this false rumour started. See a previous case implying that the French government is incompetent.",

            "content": "Misleading title and the text that give readers the false impression that lifting sanctions on Russia is the position of the German authorities. It also pushes a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that sanctions against Russia are senseless and ineffective. In fact, the sanctions from the US and the EU (including Germany) do not aim to punish Russia or the Russian people but were introduced to send a clear signal to the Russian government after Russia's illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula, deployment of armed formations in eastern Ukraine, and the downing of the Malaysian passenger plane MH17. The\u00a0first round of EU sanctions against Russia was\u00a0introduced on 17 March 2014. Later, in view of Russia's actions destabilising the situation in eastern Ukraine, the EU\u00a0imposed\u00a0economic sanctions in July 2014 and reinforced them in September 2014. The latest decision on a six-month extension of EU sanctions against Russia was taken in December 2019, to last until 31 July 2020. The false narrative about sanctions being unproductive is often backed by false statistics. For example, the alleged economic growth of two percent does not withstand scrutiny. In 2018, the inflation rate went up and the rouble depreciated 20% against the dollar. EUvsDisinfo has demonstrated that Russian media generalises singular incidents very often in order to produce stories that fit the Kremlin\u2019s narrative. Read similar cases on Western sanctions alleging that the EU suffers from its own sanctions more than Russia, EU sanctions against Russia are not democratic and that European Council sanctions are irrational and unjustified.",

We are living in the period of the end of liberalism and its \u201cobviousness\u201d as global meta-narrative, the end of its measures and standards. Human societies will soon become free floating: no more dogmas, no more dollar-imperialism, no more free market spells, no more Fed dictatorship or global stock exchanges, no more subservience to the world media elite. Each pole will build its future on its own civilizational foundations. It is obviously impossible to say what this will look like or what it will lead to. However, it is already clear that the old world order is becoming a thing of the past, and quite distinct contours of a new reality are emerging before us. What neither ideologies, nor wars, nor fierce economic battles, nor terror, nor religious movements have been able to do, has been accomplished by an invisible, yet deadly virus. It brought with it death, pain, horror, panic, sorrow\u2026 but also the future.",

However, Lviv does not have, and never has had, a metro. Metro systems in Ukraine can be found only in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro. The \"Lviv Metro\" is a well-known Internet meme in Ukraine that makes fun of Russian chauvinism and Ukrainophobia. According to a legend, it was built \"by Bandera during the Nazi occupation of the city during WWII using Russian slave labour, and its lines are in the shape of a trident.\" Russian media periodically publish fake news about the Lviv metro. For example, in the summer of 2018, they reported that \"a monster unknown to science was caught in the Lviv metro.\" Read a similar case that Stepan Bandera was an agent for Hitler.",

The pandemic has buried globalisation, the open society, and the global capitalist system. The virus has destroyed the major myths underpinning globalisation, such as the myths claiming that open borders and interdependence among countries are beneficial, that international organisations are capable of dealing with emergency situations, that the global economy can cope with grave challenges. The coronavirus pandemic is a turning point in world history. As a result of the pandemic, the world order is crumbling, liberalism and its total ideological domination are coming to an end, and a multipolar world is coming into being. The coronavirus has brought death, suffering, horror, panic, pain but it is also ushering in the future.",

The narrative of \u00a0\u201cimminent collapse\u201d \u00a0is one of the core instruments of pro-Kremlin disinformation outlets, used to spread demoralisation and self-doubt among target audiences, as well as to sow discord, panic, and diminish trust in national authorities, the EU and international institutions. The article provides no evidence to support its sweeping, apocalyptic claims. The Covid-19 pandemic - which is closing borders, severely restricting travel and disrupting supply chains - will provoke a global recession, but it will not be able to stop the globalising trend of recent decades. Globalisation has brought significant benefits for billions of people, and most of the world will not be eager to do away with easy travel and the free movement of people, goods and capital. Covid-19 will likely bring about a new phase in globalisation, but not its breakdown. The coronavirus crisis, as well as future pandemics, can be effectively brought under control only by deepening transnational cooperation. Such collaboration is already underway in the scientific and medical community, which is accelerating its efforts to understand the virus and discover a cure. While short-term quarantine is essential to stop epidemics, nationalist isolationism will lead to economic collapse without offering any real protection against infectious diseases. Read here a previous case claiming that the coronavirus represents the end of globalisation.",

            "description": "There is no certainty that this new coronavirus called COVID-19 is any more dangerous than any other virus in the past, but the ruling class and their minions in the mainstream media and beyond, are screaming at the top of their lungs that this is the scourge of mankind, and that tens of millions of Americans will become infected, and that millions might die. This is being promulgated by government at every level, by so-called national and world health organizations, and by a complicit media that seemingly does as it is told by those holding political power. This is being done regardless of the fact that no one knows much about this so-called virus, knows little or nothing about its true origin, and knows little about its mutations. Also, politicians, claimed authorities, and alleged\u00a0experts\u00a0are in the dark as to how particular cultures have been more susceptible than others, and are unwilling to discuss that the probable cause of this is due to a man-made strain created in a bio-weapons lab, even though a preponderance of evidence points in that direction. All possibilities should be discussed. [\u2026] Has all this panic been planned? The impending economic collapse caused by the Federal Reserve and its massive money printing is most likely going to be falsely blamed on the coronavirus, so what is the connection? Was this virus created for the purpose of covering up responsibility for an economic meltdown? Was it created to harm the economy of China and Iran? If not, is it being purposely used for these purposes? Is population control due to all these factors mentioned sought by the ruling class, and is this virus the impetus for gaining that control?",

While many baseless conspiracy theories have\u00a0emerged all around the world amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, there is no evidence confirming the claim that COVID-19 affects fertility in people. An article recently published on the Hubei government's website and deleted a few hours later suggests that there is a \"theoretical\" risk to men's reproductive health. Dire consequences are rare unless people have chronic cardiovascular or respiratory illnesses. Many other claims have been pushed by pro-Kremlin media since the outbreak started in January, for example, that governments overestimate the threat, that it was born in a laboratory to infect Chinese, that it is an element of hybrid warfare and that the remedy has been developed in Ukraine.",

            "content": "Conspiracy theory. It is one of many pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives alleging that the US is behind the so-called colour revolutions around the world. It is also consistent with a narrative denying any role for Russia in the Russo-Georgian 2008 war, and presenting it instead as a conflict between South Ossetia and Georgia. See related disinformation claims alleging that the US was behind the public protests in Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia, France, Georgia, Venezuela, and Russia. The European Union reiterates its firm support to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognized borders. Unfortunately, Russian military presence in both Abkhazia and South Ossetia continues in violation of international law and commitments undertaken by Russia under the 12 August 2008 agreement, mediated by the European Union. Previously pro-Kremlin disinformation claimed that Obama and Soros were jointly provoking colour revolutions, that Belarus to become a colony of the West, that gender theories and identity policies are used by the US to bring down disobeying governments and that Ukraine is enslaved to Europe after Maidan.",

            "content": "Part of the recurring pro-Kremlin narrative that\u00a0Crimea is Russian territory. Ukraine filed a lawsuit against Russia on 16 September 2016, concerning the Kremlin's violations of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea in the Kerch Strait and the Sea of \u200b\u200bAzov. The Kremlin appealed that the Permanent Court of Arbitration does not have jurisdiction to consider this case, but the court rejected Russia's objections on 21 February 2020 and determined it would hear Ukraine's claims. Ukraine insists in its lawsuit that since 2014, Russia has hindered Ukraine from using natural resources from its own marine areas: including fish resources and huge oil and gas reserves. Also, that Russia impedes free navigation through the Kerch Strait.\u00a0 The Permanent Court of Arbitration published a decision on preliminary objections of the Russian Federation on March 16, but the Tribunal had issued the award on 21 February 2020. The Permanent Court of Arbitration really is not authorised to consider the issue of the occupation of the Ukrainian peninsula, but it is able to rule on territorial waters. Moreover, in the judgment of the court, there are no words that the court \"refused to recognise Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty over Crimea\", as claimed. The court ruled that it unanimously \"upholds the Russian Federation\u2019s objection that the Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Ukraine\u2019s claims, to the extent that a ruling of the Arbitral Tribunal on the merits of Ukraine\u2019s claims necessarily requires it to decide, directly or implicitly, on the sovereignty of either Party over Crimea.\"\u00a0 The case of the occupation of Crimea will be considered by The International Criminal Court in The Hague, presumably this year.\u00a0 Read more information in a similar case claiming The Hague court recognised Crimea as Russian.",

Three conclusions can be drawn from the spread of coronavirus. First, the US will betray Europe at the earliest opportunity, they will not defend the Baltic states in case of military aggression. Second, the EU will collapse. Deep divisions among EU countries will become even deeper after the coronavirus. The EU\u2019s migration crisis pushed the UK towards Brexit, similarly the absence of solidarity in combating coronavirus may provoke Italy\u2019s exit from the EU. Third, Russia and China turn out to be more successful than the US and the EU. The latter\u2019s status of promised land is turning into an exclusion zone. Russia and many non-Western countries proved to be more effective in addressing new threats. This means that the West\u2019s global role will decrease even faster than before.",

Read our past analysis 5 Common Pro-Kremlin Disinformation Narratives to learn more about this and the other most frequent propagandistic narratives. See earlier disinformation cases alleging that the U.S. will easily betray the Baltic states and hand them over to Russia, that Italy, Spain, Portugal, and possibly even France are in line to exit the EU, that a number of EU countries teeter on the brink of default, and that the EU is rotten and countries are leaving it. This case is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about socio-economic degradation in the Baltic States as opposed to their alleged well-being under the USSR and EU's imminent collapse due to coronavirus epidemic. In fact, the economic situation of all three Baltic States is strong and demonstrates some of the leading economic growth indicators in the EU. The dynamics over the past years are available here. Read earlier disinformation cases alleging that coronavirus and economic crisis caught the EU by surprise because of its Russophobia, that the Baltic states are dying because they chose not to be with Russia, that Lithuania will be depopulated in 20 years, that the EU intentionally destroyed economies of the Baltic states, and that they have lost industry, agriculture, and population as a result of EU membership.",

            "content": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Lithuania and the Astravets Nuclear Power Plant in Belarus. On 20 April 2017, the Lithuanian parliament\u00a0passed a bill\u00a0imposing a ban on import of electricity from Belarus' nuclear power plant in Astravets. It was reported in early February 2020 that the governments of the three Baltic nations\u00a0will sign a declaration of intent\u00a0to oppose electricity purchases from the Astravets NPP. Earlier the Latvian Prime Minister reiterated, that the Latvian government has decided not to buy electricity from Belarus. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are aiming to synchronize their electricity grid to continental Europe by 2025, hence switching away from the Russian-Belarusian electricity network. For background: Lithuania\u00a0opposes the construction of the Astravets Nuclear power Plant\u00a0(NPP) as the project does not comply with the international standards of environmental protection and nuclear safety, and is built on the site that was not duly justified over alternatives, according to Lithuania. On 7 June 2011,\u00a0Lithuania lodged a complaint with the Implementing Committee of the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment\u00a0(the Espoo Convention) on the Astravets nuclear power plant case. The February 2019 draft decision of the Meeting of the Parties of the Espoo Convention\u00a0acknowledged that Belarus had failed to comply with some Convention provisions and encouraged Belarus and Lithuania to continue bilateral expert consultations. See earlier\u00a0disinformation cases concerning the Belarusian NPP, including claims that\u00a0Lithuania fights against Belarusian NPP\u00a0on the orders of Sweden and Finland, Dalia Grybauskait\u0117's opposition to the NPP is an attempt\u00a0to hide Lithuania's own failures in nuclear power,\u00a0that the \"Chernobyl\" series aimed\u00a0to discredit the Belarusian power plant and Belarus-Russia relations\u00a0and that Western-financed environmental NGOs in Belarus\u00a0stage a big campaign against Rosatom and Russia.",

The current coronavirus (2019-nCoV) comes from a family of viruses that include other viruses such as SARS and MERS. The identity of the animal source of the coronavirus, named nCoV-2019, has been one of the key questions for researchers. Coronaviruses are known to circulate in mammals and birds, and scientists have already suggested that nCoV-2019 originally came from bats. One of the previous coronaviruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, spread from bats to civet cats to humans. A group of 27 prominent public health scientists have condemned rumours and conspiracy theories about the origin of coronavirus outbreak. \"We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.The authors of\u00a0The Lancet\u00a0statement note that\u00a0scientists from several countries who have studied SARS-CoV-2 \u201coverwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, just like many other viruses that have recently emerged in humans.

            "content": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative claiming that\u00a0NATO is encircling Russia and that US-led military exercises, Cold Response and Defender-Europe 2020, are directed against Russia. Find similar cases here. Cold Response 2020 is a Norwegian-led military exercise in northern Norway and not directed against Russia. Norway is a leading nation in NATO when it comes to cold weather operations, and has extensive experience in this field. This makes Norway a natural and experienced host for winter exercises such as Cold Response. The main aim of the exercise is to secure the Norwegian Armed Forces and allies' ability to conduct multinational joint exercises with a high-intensity combat scenario in demanding winter conditions. The exercise is now being terminated, due to the ongoing coronavirus situation in Norway.  Defender Europe 2020 is not aimed against Russia and is defensive in nature. NATO\u2019s secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg affirmed that it is not directed against any particular country. Its purpose is to practice the rapid deployment of large-scale forces across the Atlantic into Europe, demonstrating the US military\u2019s ability to quickly send a massive contingent to support NATO and respond to any crisis. In response to the current outbreak of the COVID-19 virus and recent guidance by the United States Secretary of Defence, the exercise has been modified in size and scope. You can see other examples of disinformation about NATO in our database, such as its never-ending provocations, its attempts to block Moscow in its sphere of influence, the Alliance's permanent targeting of Russia and Belarus, its role as a US subjugation tool for other countries and its unreliability to defend its members or its plans to continue attacking other countries, and that Defender 2020 is for testing options for invading the Kaliningrad region.",

In 2017, Poland introduced\u00a0new laws\u00a0to ban totalitarian propaganda. According to this Law, up to 230 Soviet monuments may be replaced, a decision to be made by Polish local authorities. The Polish MFA\u00a0underlines\u00a0that Red Army burial places and cemeteries situated in Poland will be carefully protected. The law states that it is only possible to dismantle and remove symbolic monuments to the Red Army. In 2015, Pawe\u0142 Ukielski, Deputy Head of the Polish Institute of Historical Remembrance, published an open letter to the Russians, in which he explained the need to remove the symbolic monuments to the Red Army from Polish public places (text in\u00a0Polish\u00a0and\u00a0Russian). According to him, free Poland perceives these monuments as symbols of captivity by the totalitarian USSR. In some cases, the Soviet monuments glorify the Red Army generals, who were involved in military\u00a0crimes\u00a0against the Poles. The Polish Government does not implement the centralised policy of replacement of the Red Army monuments, such decisions are taken by the local authorities. Read similar cases connected to the issue of the Red Army monuments -\u00a0Monuments to Soviet soldiers are massively demolished and damaged in Ukraine, Poland and Baltic countries;\u00a0Removal of the monument to Marshall Konev is a violation of the Czech-Russian Agreement of 1993;\u00a0A monument to the Soviet soldier-liberator demolished in Lithuania.",

Many other claims have been pushed by pro-Kremlin media since the outbreak started in January, for example, that\u00a0governments overestimate the threat, that it was\u00a0born in a laboratory\u00a0to infect Chinese, that it is an element of\u00a0hybrid warfare\u00a0and that the\u00a0remedy has been developed in Ukraine.",

It is also consistent with previous narratives alleging that the Euromaidan is one of many colour revolutions prepared by the West and the EU. The EU is the largest donor to Ukraine. Since 2014, the EU has provided Ukraine with billions of Euros of assistance. On average, the EU has given Ukraine \u20ac650 million. From 2014 to 2017, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development provided an additional \u20ac3.5 billion. In general, the EU has funded projects in the humanitarian field, provided assistance to stabilise the macro-financial situation, given grants and loans for capacity building, energy reforms and fighting against corruption. The free trade agreement improved trade in agricultural products, thus benefitting Ukraine. Currently, Ukrainian exporters have a right to export their products to the EU without paying customs duties on some products. Based on 2016-2019 numbers, Ukraine was among the top 3 suppliers of agricultural products to the EU. In 2017, Ukrainian agricultural export increased by 8.5% bringing an additional $477.7 million of income. In 2018-2019 financial year, Ukrainian exporters sold products for a record \u20ac6.3 billion. Already in 2014, the EU has cancelled import tax on 95% of Ukrainian goods. The demonstrations which began in Kyiv in November 2013 \u2013 called \"Maidan\", or \"Euromaidan\" \u2013 were a result of the Ukrainian people's frustration with former President Yanukovych's last-minute U-turn when, after seven years of negotiation, he refused to sign the EU\u2013Ukraine Association Agreement and halted progress towards Ukraine's closer relationship with the EU as a result of Russian pressure. For more cases about the Euromaidan protests, see\u00a0here. See a similar case alleging that Ukraine's chances of joining the EU are miserable, the economy is destroyed and industry in ruins.",

The report implies that without access to the entire 36,000-page case file, the accused Russian national will not be able to mount an effective defence. It also falsely claims that translation of case files and any other relevant documents can only be provided by the lawyer of the defendant. A 10 March statement by the Dutch Public Prosecution Service provides an exhaustive refutation of these concerns, and is thus worth citing at length: \"Before this hearing, the Public Prosecution Service provided a Russian translation of the notice of summons and accusation and the general account. That account is a detailed summary of the case file comprising (in the Dutch version) 147 pages. This took a considerable amount of time. In addition, the Public Prosecution Service has undertaken to provide a Russian translation of the personal case file: an overview of the investigation with regard to the defendant Pulatov of (in the Dutch version) 68 pages. [...] The Public Prosecution Service believes that these documents will provide the defendant with sufficient insight into the charges and the evidence adduced by the Public Prosecution Service. On the basis of these documents and the further discussion of other information in the case file in the consultations with his counsel (with the aid of an interpreter or his Russian lawyer), the defendant should be able to carefully determine the course of action he wishes to adopt during the proceedings.\" The statement also makes it clear that translation of other, non-essential documents must be separately requested by the defence counsel, along with an explanation \"why the defence considers translation necessary. This is in accordance with Dutch (article 32a, paragraph 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure) and European legislation [Article 3, paras. 1-4 of Directive 2010/64/EU].",

            "description": "The coronavirus may be a tool in the silent competition of the big powers. After the Vietnam war, warmongering Western elites learnt that very often that the answer is not conventional war, much less when you\u2019re trying to hit strategic enemies like China or Iran, who have capabilities for a nuclear response or high resistance. In this case, you take a different route. An interesting fact is that coronavirus is not a pandemic aiming to kill a lot of people, but to achieve other effects such as social and economic re-engineering, without dropping a single bomb. When the mortality rate is inversely proportional to the panic caused, it is legitimate to think that we are dealing not with a biological weapon but with a sophisticated tool at the service of psychological warfare. The final project is the destruction of nation states.",

We have been prepared for it through the biggest indoctrination machine in the world, the US cultural industry: through films, series and documentaries. Millions of people have been modelled to unconsciously know what to do in the face of an epidemic that kills a big part of humanity. The mortality rate is what decides whether we are seeing a social experiment or the first stage of an armageddon: as with the N-bomb, which was able to kill all humans without destroying critical infrastructure, a coronavirus with a higher lethality rate could be the true apocalyptic weapon.",

Eight years later, casually, there is an epidemic outbreak that kills much more old people than young ones.

US internal defence protocol Garden Plot outlined plans to confront domestic unrest caused by social inequality or massive phenomenons, as we can consider a pandemic. Now, the New York governor can deploy the National Guard without being accused of restricting liberties and democracy.

            "content": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative aiming to discredit the International Joint Investigation (JIT)\u00a0 into the downing of flight MH17 and the subsequent trial. The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) - which is comprised of the Dutch Public Prosecution Service officials and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy. At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was\u00a0taken\u00a0back to the Russian Federation. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17 originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, the Dutch Public Persecution service will persecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of MH17 and murdering the 298 persons on board. The public hearing is\u00a0started on 9 March 2020 in the Netherlands. The European Union and NATO have\u00a0called\u00a0on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability. On the basis of the JIT\u2019s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the BUK installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are\u00a0formally\u00a0holding Russia accountable. Read other disinformation narratives alleging that\u00a0The Netherlands is going to sabotage the MH17 trial,\u00a0The MH17 trial will be a show process, and that\u00a0There was no BUK, MH17 crashed because of an explosion on board.",

This message is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the morally corrupt West and threatened traditional values. The Istanbul Convention (the Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence) is a treaty of the Council of Europe that opens the path for creating a legal framework at a pan-European level to protect women against all forms of violence, and prevent, prosecute and eliminate violence against women and domestic violence. So far, the Convention was ratified by 33 states. The Armenian Ministry of Justice clarifies that the Convention does not threaten Armenia's traditional values. The Convention states that traditions, cultures and religion cannot justify violence against women. In addition, the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe issued an opinion that \"there are no provisions in that Convention that could be said to 'contradict' the Constitution of Armenia.\" Read similar cases claiming that the Istanbul Convention will destroy traditional families and that it is attacking identity and traditions, that an influx of 50 000 perverts is expected from abroad and that Istanbul convention is a threat to the Armenian Army.",

            "content": "The claim frames NATO as the cause and only responsible for Afghanistan\u2019s destruction. In reality, when NATO took the leading role in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in 2001, the country had undergone 21 years of war, including a 9-year invasion by USSR forces followed by another decade of civil war, none of which are mentioned. The war that erupted after the Soviet invasion left around one million dead, several million refugees and most of the country in ruins. The subsequent war among quarrelling Afghan factions increased already widespread destruction. The battle for Kabul in 1992-1996, for example, destroyed most of the capital, which had been largely spared in the previous years. You can see other examples of pro-Kremlin disinformation on Afghanistan, such as claims that former Afghan president Hamid Karzai called Russia to liberate his nation from US occupation; that the West and the US are ferrying Islamic State members to Afghanistan to use them against China, as part of a so-called \u201cAnaconda ring\u201d; or that NATO is denying the presence of terrorists in the country but the FSB has evidence of it.",

In fact, it was Russia that instigated the military conflict in Ukraine, not the European Union or the Eastern Partnership (EaP). The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has stated that \"the information available suggests that the situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation\". This international armed conflict began at the latest on 26 February 2014 when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of the Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian government. The European Union stated in July 2014 that \"arms and fighters continue flowing into Ukraine from the Russian Federation\".\u00a0 Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted Russia's military presence in Ukraine in 2015. Ukraine has repeatedly provided evidence of Russia's role in the war in the east of the country.\u00a0In January 2017, the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that Kyiv filed a lawsuit in the International Court of Justice of the United Nations with the aim of bringing Russia to account for committing acts of terrorism and discrimination, which are the result of its illegal aggression against Ukraine. The lawsuit contains all the facts of Russian aggression against Ukraine, evidence of the illegal annexation of the Crimea, and the occupation of Donbas. According to the US Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), Russian special forces and troops operated to mobilise, lead, equip, and support separatist militias in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine from spring 2014 to the present.",

Talking about the Joint Investigation Team, as the most victims of the catastrophe were the citizens of Australia and the Netherlands, the participation of these two countries in JIT is legitimate, while the participation of Belgium and Ukraine is \u201csuspicious\u201d. There was absolutely no ground to involve Belgium in the investigation. One should take into account though, that the country is the brain centre (sic!) of both the EU and the NATO. Also, Kyiv\u2019s participation is questionable, as it is the main suspect in shooting down the flight.",

A Joint Investigation Team (JIT) is an investigation team set up for a fixed period, based on an agreement between two or more EU Member States and/ or competent authorities, for a specific purpose. On the one hand, two Europol member states should participate in a JIT, according to Europol. That is the reason why Belgium is involved in its work. On the other hand, there has been no information on any activities of Belgium in the criminal investigation of the downing of MH17. Therefore it is safe to say that Belgium's role in the JIT is rather formal. The JIT, which is comprised of the Dutch Public Prosecution Service officials and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, and Ukraine - has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, the Dutch Public Prosecution Service will prosecute Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinskiy, Oleg Pulatov, and Leonid Kharchenko for causing the crash of MH17 and murdering the 298 persons on board. The trial opened on 9 March in the Netherlands. The European Union and NATO called\u00a0on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability. On the basis of the JIT\u2019s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the BUK installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are\u00a0formally holding Russia accountable. Find further disinformation narratives here about how The Netherlands is going to sabotage the MH17 trial,\u00a0The MH17 trial will be a show process, and that\u00a0There was no BUK, MH17 crashed because of an explosion on board.",

Covid-19 is in fact an ordinary viral disease with a slightly higher mortality from complications for people of old age or people with weakened immunity.

Looking at the current situation in Europe, one could suppose that some forces have seized an opportunity and are now fueling the coronavirus crisis intentionally.",

This is a continuation of pro-Kremlin\u00a0disinformation efforts about the coronavirus outbreak, aiming to put blame on the West for allegedly exploiting the outbreak for their own purposes, namely isolating China. While many baseless conspiracy theories have emerged all around the world amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, there is no evidence that Western media are deliberately promoting them with malign intent. On the other hand, there is mounting evidence\u00a0that pro-Kremlin media are spreading disinformation on the disease\u00a0for political purposes through a coordinated campaign. The mortality rate of the coronavirus has varied by country and estimates differ, however, it is more deadly than most strains of the flu. Since it is a new disease, humans do not have any immunity to it. The rapid spread of the virus around the world threatens to overwhelm public health systems, particularly in poorer countries, resulting in more deaths and other adverse societal and economic impacts. In a statement on 5 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organisation drove home the gravity of the situation, saying: \"this epidemic is a threat for every country, rich and poor. [...] This is not a drill. [...] Although COVID-19 presents an acute threat now, it is absolutely essential that countries do not lose this opportunity to strengthen their preparedness systems.\" For related disinformation cases, see here.",

            "content": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative aiming to discredit the International Joint Investigation (JIT) into the downing of flight\u00a0MH17. These narratives have resurfaced due to start of the trial in the Netherlands on 9th March 2020. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, the Dutch Public Prosecution service will prosecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of MH17 and murdering the 298 persons on board. In September 2016, the JIT disclosed that MH17 was downed with a BUK missile of the 9M38 series. In Eastern Ukraine, two parts of such a missile were found. These parts are the so-called \u2018venturi\u2019 and the \u2018casing\u2019. This regards, on the one hand, the exhaust of the missile (venturi) and, on the other hand, the casing of the missile engine (casing). The missile engine\u2019s casing shows the number 9 \u0434 1318869032. The JIT-investigation found that 9\u0434 131 relates to the number of the missile engine of the 9M38 type and/or 9M38M1 type. The number 8 is the manufacturer\u2019s code, namely: the Dolgoprudny Research and Manufacturing Enterprise in Moscow. The number 86 indicates the year of production, namely 1986. And the number 9032 is the unique identification number of this specific missile engine. As part of its efforts aimed at discrediting the JIT, Russia has sponsored a propaganda documentary titled \u201cMH17, Call for Justice\u201d. It was produced by Russian national Yana Yerlashova, a former correspondent with RT, a propaganda TV channel, which has been repeatedly accused of participating in disinformation and meddling campaigns in the U.S., across Europe, and the Middle East. In 2016, an email correspondence leak from the Donetsk News Agency revealed that Max van der Werff had taken the initiative and suggested that he discredit the investigation that proves the Kremlin\u2019s involvement in the shooting down of the aircraft. The European Union and NATO have\u00a0called\u00a0on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability.\u00a0On the basis of the JIT\u2019s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the Buk installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are\u00a0formally holding Russia accountable. Read here similar cases claiming that MH17 crashed in an area where there wasn\u2019t a single Buk anti-aircraft missile system and that there was no BUK, MH17 crashed because of an explosion on board",

            "content": "No evidence is provided to support the article\u2019s claim that liberalism has facilitated the spread of the coronavirus. This claim is consistent with the recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the coronavirus blaming the US and the West for having spread the disease or for not doing anything to contain it. The article also repeats the pro-Kremlin narrative that claims liberal societies rob nations of their sovereignty and identity, and that liberalism is the \u201cvirus\u201d that has generated the West\u2019s moral decadence, materialism, perverted values and hostility to traditional values and religion. The liberal-democratic societies of the West have not \u201cenabled the spread\u201d of coronavirus. The scientific community in these societies and around the world is striving to understand the dangerous respiratory disease COVID-19 (the coronavirus disease) and the virus that causes it. Such scientific knowledge will be critical in bringing the coronavirus pandemic under control. Historically liberal societies have been at the forefront of scientific breakthroughs that have brought about tremendous advancements in public health in the 19th and 20th centuries. The development of modern science in the West, including the growth of scientific knowledge about the causes and the means of controlling disease, is closely related to liberalism. Scientific research flourishes in liberal societies, because science relies on openness, free speech, and the freedom to associate with other thinkers. Liberal Democracy, in turn, benefits from the anti-authoritarianism inherent in scientific thinking. Read here previous cases claiming that neoliberal countries don\u2019t care about containing the coronavirus epidemic and that the coronavirus is an American biological weapon and that the coronavirus is a biological weapon created by the UK.",

            "content": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative aiming to discredit the investigation of the Joint International Team (JIT) into the downing of flight MH17. The JIT which is comprised of the Dutch Public Prosecution Service officials and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine, has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy. At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was taken\u00a0back to the Russian Federation. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17 originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, the Dutch Public Persecution service will persecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of MH17 and murdering the 298 persons on board. The public hearing took place on 9 March 2020 in the Netherlands. The European Union and NATO have\u00a0called on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability. On the basis of the JIT\u2019s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia have concluded that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the BUK installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are formally holding Russia accountable. Read similar disinformation cases alleging that the Netherlands is going to sabotage the MH17 trial, the MH17 trial will be a show process, and that there was no BUK and MH17 crashed because of an explosion on board.",

It is hardly possible to count on real justice. One of the intrigues is a list of material evidence attached to the case. For example, there are doubts that there will be the body of a Buk missile, which was presented to the world with fanfare at a press conference in May 2018 as part of the \u201csame\u201d missile that shot down the Boeing. Recall: then the Russian Ministry of Defense presented documents that irrefutably testify to the fact that it was a missile transported to Western Ukraine back in December 1986 and remained in service with the Ukrainian army after the collapse of the USSR. After that, the investigators \u201csuddenly\u201d sharply lost all interest in this material evidence.",

On the 24th of May 2018, the JIT announced its conclusion that the BUK TELAR used to shoot down MH17 came from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, a unit of the Russian armed forces from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, the Dutch Public Prosecution service are prosecuting Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of the MH17 and murdering the 289 persons on board. The public hearing started on March 9th 2020 in the Netherlands. The \"irrefutable evidence\" claimed by Russia is only a small sample of misleading claims advanced by Moscow since 2015, some of which have contradicted one another. This disinformation article refers to the claim that the Buk was of \"Ukrainian origin\" (evidence advanced by Russia which Novaya Gazeta found to be fabricated).",

A special team, known as the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), was established to conduct the\u00a0criminal investigation into the downing of the flight MH17. The JIT comprises officials from the Dutch Public Prosecution Service and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. After years of painstaking investigation, the JIT has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy (or: Pervomaiskyi). At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was\u00a0taken\u00a0back to the Russian Federation.\u00a0The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT), has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17, originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT the Dutch Public Persecution service is persecuting Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of the MH17 and murdering the 298 persons on board. The first session of the court proceedings has started on the 9th of March in the Hague. The European Union and NATO have\u00a0called\u00a0on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability.\u00a0On the basis of the JIT\u2019s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the Buk installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are\u00a0formally\u00a0holding Russia accountable.",

Firstly, Russia's interest in aiding the JIT investigation is not a relevant condition of its membership in the JIT. The crash did not take place over Russian territory and claimed no Russian lives, which precludes any basis for Moscow to be represented in the JIT. Dutch Chief Prosecutor Fred Westerbeke said that \"if MH17 were shot down over Russia, I would have suggested that Russia be made a member of the JIT group.\" A special team, known as the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), was established to conduct the\u00a0criminal investigation. The JIT comprises of officials from the Dutch Public Prosecution Service and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. The claims by Buk manufacturer Almaz-Antey were debunked in 2015 by Bellingcat.\u00a0The \"evidence\" claimed by Russia, namely radar data and the \"field experiment\" conducted by the Russian military company Almaz-Antey, is only a small sample of\u00a0misleading claims\u00a0advanced by Moscow since 2015, some of which have\u00a0contradicted one another. Also, Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta found the claim that the Buk\u00a0was of \"Ukrainian origin\"\u00a0to be\u00a0fabricated. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on the 17th of July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy.

International investigators\u00a0announced charges against four suspects accused of shooting down flight MH17 on the 19th of June 2019. The first public hearing took place on\u00a09 March 2020 in the Netherlands. The European Union and NATO have\u00a0called\u00a0on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability.\u00a0On the basis of the JIT\u2019s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the Buk installation that was used to down MH17.

The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) - which is comprised of the Dutch Public Prosecution Service officials and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy. At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was\u00a0taken\u00a0back to the Russian Federation. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17 originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, the Dutch Public Persecution service will persecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of MH17 and murdering the 298 persons on board. The first public hearing took place on 9 March 2020 in the Netherlands. The European Union and NATO have\u00a0called\u00a0on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability. On the basis of the JIT\u2019s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the BUK installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are\u00a0formally\u00a0holding Russia accountable. Read other disinformation narratives alleging that\u00a0The Netherlands is going to sabotage the MH17 trial,\u00a0The MH17 trial will be a show process, and that\u00a0There was no BUK, MH17 crashed because of an explosion on board.",

            "description": "The Prosecutors of the JIT claim they have evidence that the Buk missile system was delivered from Russia to the Donetsk region in the days preceding the launch. Russia says this is false and presents evidence that the serial number of the Buk missile can be traced back to the 1980s. At that time it was transported to the Soviet Republic of Ukraine and remained there until the collapse of the USSR. But, according to the Russians, the joint investigative team, the JIT team, ignored this crucial missing piece of the puzzle.",

On the 24 May 2018, the JIT announced its conclusion that the BUK TELAR used to shoot down MH17 came from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, a unit of the Russian armed forces from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, consisting of law enforcement agencies from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, Ukraine and the Netherlands, the Dutch Public Prosecution Service will prosecute Igor Vsevolodovich GIRKIN, Sergey Nikolayevich DUBINSKIY, Oleg Yuldashevich PULATOV and Leonid Volodymyrovych KHARCHENKO for causing the crash of the MH17 and murdering of 298 persons on board.

            "content": "The report advances recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about the MH17 crash.\u00a0While Malaysian Prime Minister, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, indeed made a statement asking for strong evidence pointing at Russia's liability, it is not true that the JIT did not present any proof or that Belgium puts into question the findings of the investigation. On the 24th of May 2018, the JIT announced its conclusion that the BUK TELAR used to shoot down MH17 came from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, a unit of the Russian armed forces from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, the Dutch Public Prosecution service are prosecuting Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of the MH17 and murdering the 289 persons on board. The public hearing started on March 9th 2020 in the Netherlands. The \"irrefutable evidence\" claimed by Russia is only a small sample of misleading claims advanced by Moscow since 2015, some of which have contradicted one another. This disinformation article refers to the claim that the Buk was of \"Ukrainian origin\" (evidence advanced by Russia which Novaya Gazeta found to be fabricated). Read our past analysis Renewed Focus on MH17 about pro-Kremlin disinformation tactics to hide the facts behind MH17 downing, and Disinformation Mash-Up: MH17 and Coronavirus about the synchronised messaging on two entirely unrelated topics: MH17 and the coronavirus outbreak. The European Union and NATO have\u00a0called\u00a0on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability. On the basis of the JIT\u2019s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the BUK installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are\u00a0formally\u00a0holding Russia accountable. Read other disinformation narratives alleging that\u00a0The Netherlands is going to sabotage the MH17 trial,\u00a0that Ukrainian regiment that shot down MH17, that CIA-controlled SBU shot MH17, and that biased JIT ignores massive data supplied by Russia.",

On 26 February 2014 the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of the Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government. The next day a referendum was announced and a vote was held on March 16, 2014 in the Peninsula of Crimea. The territory was then controlled by Russian forces, though neither Ukrainian nor Russian election code was observed.\u00a0 The European Commission for Democracy through Law, known as as the Venice Commission, declared that the referendum was illegal under both Ukrainian and Crimean Constitutions, and violated international standards and norms. On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution\u00a0in which it stated that the referendum in Crimea was\u00a0not valid\u00a0and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly\u00a0confirmed\u00a0its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea. The EU's\u00a0policy of non-recognition\u00a0of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol includes a set of restrictive measures against entities and individuals responsible for actions against Ukraine's territorial integrity.\u00a0In March 2019 on the fifth anniversary of Crimea's annexation,\u00a0the EU reiterated its position of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol. EU continues to stand in full solidarity with Ukraine, supporting its sovereignty and territorial integrity. See more\u00a0disinformation cases\u00a0 about the illegal annexation of Crimea.",

The SBU was acting with the guidance of CIA officers. Many consider the SBU the Ukrainian branch of the CIA: after the coup of February 2014, American secret services received an entire floor to use in the SBU HQ. American involvement in the downing of MH17 is indicated by the fact that no US citizens were on the flight. After shooting down the plane, they have been involved in openly falsifying results. They did this for five years; so the murderers carried out the investigation. The SBU is certainly the one who committed the crime.",

The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) - which is comprised of the Dutch Public Prosecution Service officials and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy. At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was\u00a0taken\u00a0back to the Russian Federation. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17 originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, the Dutch Public Persecution service will persecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of MH17 and murdering the 298 persons on board. The public trial opened on 9 March in The Hague. None of the men were present on the first hearing. Moreover, there is no evidence that the SBU was involved in the downing of the plane or that it was under the control of the CIA.",

The chairs were laid out in rows like seats in an airplane and represented the victims who died when a Buk missile fired from territory held by pro-Russia separatist rebels shot down the flight MH17 on July 17, 2014. The action was observed by international journalists and documented not only with photos, but also with videos. Embassy officials did not comment on this action. Background: Pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives aim to undermine the results of the MH17 investigation\u00a0and the outcomes of the future trial. The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) - which is comprised of the Dutch Public Prosecution Service officials and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy. At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was\u00a0taken\u00a0back to the Russian Federation. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17 originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, the Dutch Public Persecution service will persecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of MH17 and murdering the 298 persons on board. The first public hearing took place on 9 March 2020 in the Netherlands. The European Union and NATO have\u00a0called\u00a0on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability. On the basis of the JIT\u2019s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the BUK installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are\u00a0formally\u00a0holding Russia accountable. Read other disinformation narratives alleging that\u00a0The Netherlands is going to sabotage the MH17 trial,\u00a0The MH17 trial will be a show process, and that\u00a0There was no BUK, MH17 crashed because of an explosion on board.",

This is one of many recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives aiming to undermine the results of the MH17 investigation\u00a0and the outcomes of the future trial. The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) - which is comprised of the Dutch Public Prosecution Service officials and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy. At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was\u00a0taken\u00a0back to the Russian Federation. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17 originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, the Dutch Public Persecution service will persecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of MH17 and murdering the 298 persons on board. The first public hearing took place on 9 March 2020 in the Netherlands. The European Union and NATO have\u00a0called\u00a0on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability. On the basis of the JIT\u2019s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the BUK installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are\u00a0formally\u00a0holding Russia accountable. Read other disinformation narratives alleging that\u00a0The Netherlands is going to sabotage the MH17 trial,\u00a0The MH17 trial will be a show process, and that\u00a0There was no BUK, MH17 crashed because of an explosion on board.",

The civil society continues its destructive activities through the adoption of harmful legislation such as the bill on the media or the language law. Thus Zelenskyy largely continues Poroshenko\u2019s policies by turning Russophobia and mass-scale human rights violations into the tool of state policy on the instruction of the fifth column. The Belarusian civil society represented by allegedly independent media and initiatives promoting Belarusian language and culture (in reality, Russophobic, pro-Polish forces), is ideologically and politically close to Fascism. Otherwise, it would notice the violation of human rights in Ukraine and glorification of Nazism in Ukraine.",

            "content": "This is a mix of recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives undermining the statehood of Ukraine and advancing claims about the 2013-14 protests in Kyiv as a coup orchestrated by the West, Nazis in Ukraine, West's attempts to disrupt Belarus-Russia relations, and ubiquitous Russophobia in Ukraine and beyond. It also distorts the war in eastern Ukraine which is a well-documented act of aggression by Russian armed forces, ongoing since February 2014. For background, read our analysis: The \u201cRussophobia\u201d Myth: Appealing to the Lowest Feelings and look at earlier disinformation cases alleging that Brussels uses Russophobia as a uniting idea to prevent the EU\u2019s collapse, and about three types of Russophobia which are turning Belarus into anti-Belarus and anti-Russian state. The message paints virtually all Belarusian organisations which do not clearly follow pro-Russian policies in any field as Russophobic. The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine has been the cornerstone of Russian disinformation about the country since the very beginning of the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests, when it was used to discredit the pro-European popular uprising in Kyiv and, subsequently, the broader pro-Western shift in Ukraine's foreign policy. Far-right groups enjoyed a\u00a0very limited presence during the Euromaidan itself and had poor results in the 2014 presidential\u00a0and\u00a0parliamentary elections. In the 2019 election, far-right candidates fell short\u00a0of the 5% minimum guaranteeing entry into parliament. There was no coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Ukraine. The onset of the Euromaidan protests was a spontaneous and endogenous reaction by numerous segments of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych\u2019s sudden withdrawal from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. The protesters\u2019 demands included constitutional reform, a stronger role for parliament, the formation of a government of national unity, an end to corruption, early presidential elections and an end to violence. See the full debunk of this disinformation claim\u00a0here. Read similar cases alleging that Ukraine is a neo-Nazi state\u00a0and Ukraine is an anti-Russian state under Western control, that the West is targeting the Union State between Belarus and Russia, and that the Belarusian opposition, civic activists and independent journalists make kill lists for Western security bodies.",

This claim also attempts to delegitimise the autocephaly of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, one of the pro-Kremlin media's ongoing disinformation campaigns against Ukraine, by claiming that the US inappropriately sought to influence the process. The Constantinople Patriarchate, located in Istanbul, is one of 15 independent, self-governing Orthodox churches. However, the Constantinople Patriarchate, also known as the Ecumenical Patriarchate, enjoys the status of primus inter pares (first among equals) and is regarded by other Orthodox Christians as the representative and spiritual leader of the Orthodox world. The decisions of the Constantinople Patriarchate are made only by the Patriarch and the Holy Synod. The granting of autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine was supported by all members of the Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate after months of careful\u00a0preparations and considerations. For more information, see here. See similar disinformation claiming that Ukrainian autocephaly is a US project. See similar recent narratives claiming that the US is trying to divide the Orthodox Church: The US stands behind the pressure upon the Serbian Church of Montenegro, The US government is trying to eradicate Christianity.",

            "content": "The story advances a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the MH17 crash. The \"massive data\" which the report refers to is the \"field experiment\" by Russian state defence contractor Almaz-Antey, allegedly demonstrating that the type of projectile which downed the plane had not been used by Russian forces since 2011; radar data which the Russian Ministry of Defence \"discovered\" in 2016, and which contradict the readings Moscow presented in 2014. Both sets of Russia-supplied evidence have long been debunked. In 2015 Russia vetoed UN resolution that would have established an international tribunal for the purpose of prosecuting persons responsible for crimes connected with the downing of MH17. There are no legal or logical grounds for granting Russian officials an active role in the MH17 investigation, regardless of their professed enthusiasm. The crash did not take place over Russian territory and claimed no Russian lives, which precludes any basis for Moscow to be represented in the JIT. Dutch Chief Prosecutor Fred Westerbeke\u00a0told a Russian newspaper that \"if MH17 were shot down over Russia, I would have suggested that Russia be made a member of the JIT group.\" The notion that the Dutch authorities would pressure their own judiciary in order to score a public relations coup is deeply unconvincing. The Netherlands consistently ranks near the top of the pile in terms of judicial independence, e.g. in rankings compiled by the World Economic Forum\u00a0 (3rd place globally, p. 419) and the World Justice Project (5th place globally, p. 16).",

The current US nuclear strategy is detailed in the Nuclear Posture Review [NPR], issued by the Department of Defence in February 2018. This states that the US would consider the use of nuclear weapons only under \u201cextreme circumstances\u201d to defend the vital interests of the US, its allies and partners. It defines \u201cextreme circumstances,\u201d as both nuclear attacks and \u201csignificant non-nuclear strategic attacks\u201d against \u201cU.S., allied or partner civilian populations or infrastructure, and attacks on U.S. or allied nuclear forces, their command and control, or warning and attack assessment capabilities\u201d. The NPR also stresses that deterrence continues to be the central principle of US strategy: it states that \u201cthe highest US nuclear policy and strategy priority is to deter potential adversaries from nuclear attack of any scale\u201d, and that US nuclear forces play a critical role in \u201cdeterring nuclear and non-nuclear attack\u201d.

            "content": "One of many recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives aiming to undermine the results of the MH17 investigation\u00a0and the outcomes of the future trial. The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) - which is comprised of the Dutch Public Prosecution Service officials and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy. At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was\u00a0taken\u00a0back to the Russian Federation. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17 originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, the Dutch Public Persecution service will persecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of MH17 and murdering the 298 persons on board. The first public hearing took place on 9 March 2020 in the Netherlands. The European Union and NATO have\u00a0called\u00a0on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability. On the basis of the JIT\u2019s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the BUK installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are\u00a0formally\u00a0holding Russia accountable. Read other disinformation narratives alleging that\u00a0The Netherlands is going to sabotage the MH17 trial,\u00a0The MH17 trial will be a show process, and that\u00a0There was no BUK, MH17 crashed because of an explosion on board.",

            "content": "Disinformation concerning nuclear issues and crime in Ukraine. In Ukraine, ionising radiation sources have been widely used in the medical field, nuclear energy, industry, geology, the military-industrial complex, as well as in scientific research. In Ukraine, all enterprises and organisations using ionising radiation sources are required to obtain an appropriate license from the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate and many other permits. According to the data of the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate in western Ukraine and Transcarpathia, in 2019, 358 different radiation facilities were used, but Uzhhorod National University did not have a permit for the use of any sources. That is, there was no active IBN-7 in the educational institution (p. 59-60). Also, the Russian media claim that the \u201cstolen nuclear source\u201d will soon be \u201csmuggled out\u201d to EU countries. However, all entry and exit control points at the border, both in Ukraine and in the EU, are equipped with special equipment to help detect illegal shipments of radioactive materials. In 2019, three such cases were identified on the western borders of Ukraine. The seized radioactive materials were transferred to a special nuclear storage facility \"Radon\". (p. 59-60) Moreover, the disinformation mentions that the IBN-7 was released in 1991, however, the \"Mayak\" enterprise\u2019s website, which produces IBN-7, says that the maximum service life of this type of IBN is 10 years. After that, fast neutron sources are sent for nuclear disposal. (p.45)",

There is a certain degree of sovereignty like that of a dog tied to a short leash. In the East of NATO and the EU, a Lithuanian political dog is tied to guard the yard. It has freedom within the chain, freedom of expression that is made to address two Eastern neighbors \u2013 Russia and Belarus.",

Lithuania is an independent state, which makes sovereign decisions about its foreign and domestic policy.\u00a0 NATO's increased presence in the Baltic Sea region has been at the request of the Baltic states.

There are great scientists who confirmed this concept (biological attack), including the Russian biological scientist Igor (Nikulin) who emphasised that this is not a normal virus and was formulated in laboratories. The US has 25 dangerous laboratories surrounding China, Russia and Iran. Even in American films, we see that the American administration carries about experiments and testing on Americans themselves. It\u2019s quite possible that Europe and America will gradually reveal the fact that they already possess a vaccine (for the Coronavirus), but are just waiting for the price to be raised in order to make more money by using it later on commercially.",

The Polish authorities do not promote any policy of \u201cintimidation with Russia\u201d and they do not create \u00a0\u201cinsane hysterias\u201d connected to Russia. The main current Russia-connected concerns of Poland are a result of the Russian annexation of Crimea and its involvement in the military conflict in Donbas. The Polish government\u00a0shows its full support to solving the Russia-Ukraine conflict and complete restoration of\u00a0territorial integrity\u00a0of Ukraine. Poland does not carry out an information war against Russia and it does not spread anti-Russian propaganda.

            "description": "The propaganda promotion of the so-called Katyn affair was approved by Adolf Hitler himself, In 1943, near the small village of Katyn, 14 kilometers to the west of Smolensk, a mass grave of executed Polish prisoners of war was discovered in the Kozi Gory tract. An end has not yet been put to this tragic story. On April 13, Poland intends to conduct another anti-Russian campaign dedicated to the 80th anniversary of the Katyn crime. Katyn was the work of the Nazis, and not the Stalinist leadership of the NKVD. This version, in fact, is confirmed by the verdict of the Nuremberg tribunal. The Nuremberg International Military Tribunal indicted Herman Goering, number two, and Alfred Jodl, acting chief of the Wehrmacht\u2019s High Command, for the Katyn crime. These are documented facts.",

The attempts continue even when Russian authorities fully recognised the USSR's responsibility at official level. By the decision of the President of Russia from April 28th 2010, electronic copies of documents about Katyn have been posted on the official website of the Federal Archival Agency.\u00a0 The collection of documents includes the \"Memorandum of the People's Commissar of Internal Affairs of the USSR L.P. Beria to I.V. Stalin with a proposal to entrust the NKVD of the USSR to consider to study in a special manner cases against Polish citizens held in prison camps of the NKVD of the USSR and prisons in the western regions of Ukraine and Belarus\" from March 5th 1940. The verdict\u00a0 execution, can be read on the 3rd page of the document, approved by Stalin. \"Study in a special manner\" is the term meaning the absence of a proper trial, in use during Stalin's purges. The Katyn crime was first recognised by the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990. Russian Human Rights activists have been working since 1989 in order to collect full documentation, to pass Polish victims' descendants requests to the Russian authorities and to edit the complete list of Polish citizens subjected to repressions in the USSR, including in Katyn in 1940. The Nuremberg International Military Tribunal did not indict German Nazi defendants for this crime, nor, therefore, sentenced them for it. See other recent disinformation cases about \"Poland to cause start of the world war II\", and more cases about about Katyn massacre.",

Every journalist and editor was told how to do their job and those who didn\u2019t get it were driven out of the profession. Now, central media outlets are more or less controlled and do what they\u2019re told: push LGBT rights, global warming, Greta Thunberg, the arrival of migrants into Europe, chemical attacks in Syria, Russian interference, protests in Hong Kong, and basically whatever fits with the current political agenda. Against the rapid deterioration of \u201csoft power\u201d and the collapse of liberal ideology in the West, we are starting to see a rather strict censorship being imposed to protect the propaganda machine that has been so painstakingly created.",

According to Reporters Without Borders, the freest countries in the world in terms of press freedom are predominantly European countries, including Norway, Finland, Sweden, Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, Belgium, Estonia, Portugal, Germany, etc. On the other hand, Russia is ranked as \u201cnot free\u201d, according to Freedom House\u2019s Freedom of the Press\u00a0report. According to Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index, Russia is ranked 149th among 180 countries. 38 journalists have been\u00a0murdered in Russia since 1993 for preparing investigative materials on corruption, politics and human rights violations. Almost all leading media outlets in the country are controlled by persons affiliated with the authorities or the Kremlin. See similar cases that there is a deterioration of democracy in the West, the EU and the US violate the rights of Russian journalists, and the ECHR and UN Convention on Human Rights strongly restrict freedom of expression. An unfounded claim to depict Russia as more democratic than other countries and portray the West in a negative light, where freedoms are restricted. The right to organise manifestations is protected by the Swedish constitution. Permission to stage a demonstration is needed only within city limits and in areas of industry, ports etc. For organising a demonstration without permission, punishment is, according to Swedish law on public order, up to six months prison. The right to participate is still protected by the consitution. According to Swedish criminal code, staging violent riots is punished with up to four years prison.",

The British and Belarusian armies have already cooperated for military exchanges in previous years. The event is held on a bilateral basis in the framework of cooperation in the training of peacekeeping personnel, aiming at Belarus' participation in the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon. According to Belarusian Defence Minister, Oleg Belokonev, the country wants to remain close to Russia but with a military training connection to NATO, as is the case of Serbia. This is part of a recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative denying the existence of a Belarusian nationhood separated from Russia. This narrative has increased since 2018 amidst Russian pressure to further integrate both countries into a single Union State. You can see other examples in our database, such as allegations that genuine independence will only be possible in a union with Russia, that pro-Western development would mean the end of Belarus, or that the US wants to turn Belarus into a Russophobic country, destroy its economy and statehood, orchestrate a colour revolution, a coup and a foreign invasion and turn it into a colony of the West.",

            "content": "A recurring narrative\u00a0of denials which Moscow has issued regarding its involvement in the 2016 presidential election in the United States employing the long-established charge of Russophobia\u00a0which the Kremlin uses to deflect criticism, however legitimate. Before the Robert Mueller report was published, Russian meddling in the 2016 election had already been\u00a0established by US intelligence agencies. Thus, the Special Investigation was\u00a0primarily concerned\u00a0with \"whether any Americans [\u2026] joined the Russian conspiracies to influence the election\" (p.2). Mueller makes clear in his\u00a0report\u00a0that \"collusion\" is not a legal concept under US federal law, and that gathering evidence thereof would have fallen outside the scope of the special counsel investigation (p. 2). In fact, the report explicitly identifies \"numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign\" (p. 9). A number of these individuals later \"made false statements about those contacts and took other steps to obstruct\" the probe (p. 180). The report's conclusions, therefore, do nothing to absolve the Russian government. Regarding the exploitation of social media to interfere in the election,\u00a013 Russian citizens\u00a0have been criminally charged in the United States for conspiring to \u201csow discord in the U.S. political system,\u201d including the 2016 presidential election. Three Russian companies\u00a0were also indicted by a federal grand jury. One of them is the infamous Internet Research Agency, a troll factory based in St. Petersburg.",

            "description": "British authorities were unable to provide evidence confirming the charges against Russia, neither did they arrest the person who used the Novichok poison against a former Russian intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal. Without verifying the information or the results of the investigations, the former Theresa May government rushed to accuse Moscow of being directly behind the alleged attack and thus targeting Britain\u2019s security and stability. Until now, the British authorities have not announced the results of the investigations that were aimed at Russia\u2019s involvement on the basis of its use of the deadly Novichok chemicals used in the fabricated attack, nor did it arrest anyone involved in that attack, which led raise questions about the credibility of the British accusations and their political backgrounds. London refused Russia\u2019s participation, along with international and British investigators, in the attack\u2019s investigations. Two years later, the Salisbury incident still raises many questions, about whether the alleged assault was really chemical. Where is the physical evidence that the British authorities claimed was in their possession to implicate Russia, where are Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, and why is the Russian embassy prevented from reaching them, especially as Yulia Skripal is still a Russian citizen.",

            "content": "Recurring disinformation about the poisoning of the Skripals, attempting to divert attention from Russia's proven responsibility for the attack and resurfacing around the 2nd anniversary of this event. The disinformation message implying a UK government conspiracy behind the Skripal case is an often-used method of applying a pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Salisbury poisoning. After a hearing in the Court of Protection, British High Court Justice David Williams issued an approved judgement about what had happened to the Skripals around three weeks after their poisoning in March 2018. The British Police have presented a solid chain of evidence on the Skripal case, with pictures, connecting the suspects to the locations in the case. Parts of the material have been released to the public. The evidence was sufficient to charge two Russian nationals, Anatoliy Chepiga and Aleksandr Mishkin with the attack on the Skripals, both Russian military intelligence operatives from the GRU, who travelled to the UK using fake names and documents. Following this attack, the United Kingdom notified the OPCW, invited them to confirm the identity of the substance involved, and briefed members of the Security Council. The OPCW\u2019s independent expert laboratories confirmed the UK\u2019s identification of the Russian produced Novichok nerve agent, specifically the purity of the toxin while emphasising that the OPCW team \u201cworked independently and was not involved in the national investigation by the UK authorities. No State Party was involved in the technical work carried out by the Technical Secretariat, to ensure the integrity of the examinations and investigations. According to the UK intelligence assessment, based on open-source analysis and intelligence information, in the past decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok agents, long after it signed the Chemical Weapons Convention. Novichok was developed in Russia in the 1970s and 1980s. It is so unusual, that very few scientists outside of Russia have any real experience in dealing with it and no country outside of Russia is known to have developed the substance. See reports by CNN, BBC, the Guardian. Furthermore, regarding access to the Skripals, Yulia Skripal stated in an interview that she was aware of Russian officials\u2019 offers to meet, but that she declined to do so.\u00a0 See here for disinformation narratives about the case.",

Activists have documented the use of chemical weapons in Syria, later confirmed by OPCW. Because of this, they have become the target of an extensive Russian disinformation campaign. Read previous disinformation claims alleging that evidence confirms chemical attacks in Syria were falsified by the White Helmets, and that the chemical attacks in Syria have been staged and filmed by the media of the Western countries.",

            "content": "Russian attempts to interfere in US elections 2020 have already been well documented. In February 2020, US intelligence officers warned lawmakers that Russia was about to help both Donald Trump and Democratic aspiring candidate Bernie Sanders. Some of these efforts were described by social media investigation company Graphika in a report published in October 2019, which includes ample evidence of this process. Facebook also repeatedly suspended Russian accounts targeting US voters in the last months of 2019. This is part of a recurrent pro-Kremlin narrative denying Russia\u2019s interference in foreign elections despite overwhelming evidence, both in the US and in other countries. You can see other examples of disinformation about this subject, such as allegations that neither the US Intelligence Committee report nor the Mueller report found any evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 US elections, that there is no proof that Russia tried to influence the Brexit referendum or about the role played by RT and Sputnik in these and other processes, that \u201cabsurd\u201d accusations against Russia are an attempt to demonise it, or that the US and UK are indeed the ones who try to interfere in Europe.",

            "description": "The goal of Mr. Waszczykowski [former Head of the Polish MFA] is deeper economic dependency of Poland on the United States, this is manifested in the purchasing of expensive American gas. There is no talk about any military conflict in the region or a military confrontation between NATO and Russia as these are unreal. The constant intimidation with Russia and the spread of Russophobia has an economic dimension. Poland has to purchase American gas and weapons, provide the USA with beneficial concessions for the extraction of silver and copper and boycott the tax on the American digital giants (despite the EU position).",

The report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic is based on evidence available, including witness testimonies, video footage, data imagery as well as reports by flight spotters, flight communication intercepts and early warning observation reports, enough for the body to conclude that there was reasonable grounds to believe that a Russian aircraft participated in two episodes tantamount to war crimes (p.6). In both incidents, the Russian Air Force did not direct the attacks at a specific military objective, amounting to the war crime of launching indiscriminate attacks in civilian areas. The report also addresses human rights violations by terrorist groups -describing them as such- from the very beginning of the document, in the third paragraph of the introductory summary, as well as the actions of the Turkish and Syrian governmental armies, so the claim of bias is unfounded. This is part of a recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Russia or its allies always being falsely accused of war crimes and international law violations. You can see many other examples in our database, such as allegations that the Russian army doesn\u2019t deliberately target civilians, unlike the US, or that Amnesty International is an ideological tool of US security services, Russia\u2019s insistence on an alleged lack of interest in finding the truth in the Skripal and Litvinenko cases or in the downing of the MH17 flight, or claims about the anti-Russian bias of the OPCW, the World Anti-Doping Agency, the PACE, Ukraine\u2019s national DNA or the West in general.",

This is a conspiracy theory about the coronavirus,\u00a0and one of many recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives aiming to undermine the results of the MH17 investigation and the outcomes of the future trial. The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) - which is comprised of the Dutch Public Prosecution Service officials and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy. At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was\u00a0taken\u00a0back to the Russian Federation. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17 originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, the Dutch Public Persecution service will persecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of MH17 and murdering the 298 persons on board. The public hearing is\u00a0scheduled for 9 March 2020 in the Netherlands. The European Union and NATO have\u00a0called\u00a0on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability. On the basis of the JIT\u2019s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the BUK installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are\u00a0formally\u00a0holding Russia accountable. Read other disinformation narratives alleging that\u00a0The Netherlands is going to sabotage the MH17 trial,\u00a0The MH17 trial will be a show process, and that\u00a0There was no BUK, MH17 crashed because of an explosion on board.",

Find similar cases here. Exercise Defender-Europe 2020 is the deployment of a division-size combat-credible force from the United States to Europe, the drawing of equipment and the movement of personnel and equipment across the theatre to various training areas. The aim of the exercises is to increase strategic readiness and interoperability by exercising the U.S. military\u2019s ability to rapidly deploy a large combat-credible force and equipment from the United States to Europe; and alongside its allies and partners, quickly respond to a potential crisis. \"The joint, multinational training exercise is scheduled to take place from April to May 2020, with personnel and equipment movements occurring from February through July 2020. The exercise supports objectives defined by NATO to build readiness within the alliance and deter potential adversaries. Approximately 37,000 U.S., allied, and partner nation service members are expected to participate with roughly 20,000 soldiers deploying from the U.S,\" states the official web site of the exercises. Eighteen countries are expected to participate, with exercise activities occurring across 10 countries. More details about the exercise can be found here. At a press conference in Berlin on January 14, 2020, the Deputy Commander of the US Armed Forces in Europe, General Andrew Rawling, announced that Defender 2020 is not directed against Russia or against another country: \"These manoeuvres are not related to any particular country. In this, they differ from past exercises of the Cold War. It is a question of defence in general under various crisis scenarios.\" Read similar cases about the Kaliningrad region being threatened by NATO and US.",

            "content": "This message is in line with a recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about the West's moral decay aimed at portraying Russia as superior to the West in terms of values and morals. This narrative often claims that President Vladimir Putin saved Russia\u2019s values and identity\u00a0 from the threat of \u00a0Western decadence and that he is the only world leader that protects\u00a0 traditional European and Christian values. \u201cThreatened values\u201d is one of the most common narratives\u00a0used by pro-Kremlin outlets. The article seeks to discredit liberal democracy by repeating\u00a0 the pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the West\u2019s moral decadence, materialism, perverted values, and hostility to traditional religion, which Western governments allegedly seek to undermine and to replace with pseudo-religions (such as LGBT ideology). According to these narratives the liberal societies of the West are depraved, they seek to destroy traditional values\u00a0and to promote deviant sexual behavior. Read similar cases claiming that Western societies are decadent, worship money and are devoted to the obsessive search for pleasure, and \u00a0that\u00a0 Western Europe is moving away from its Christian roots and is dominated by materialism and the pursuit of money.",

There is no evidence that suggests that the coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is used as a weapon against other states. It comes from a family of viruses that include other viruses such as SARS and MERS. It was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in central China and has been rapidly spreading with new cases being reported in the Asia-Pacific region as well as Europe, North America and the Middle East, causing more than 3584 deaths by 08 March 2020. As of 8th March 2020, coronavirus was confirmed in over 100 countries in all continents (except Antarctica). The identity of the animal source of the coronavirus, named nCoV-2019, has been one of the key questions for the researchers. Coronaviruses are known to circulate in mammals and birds, and scientists have already suggested that nCoV-2019 originally came from bats. One of the previous coronaviruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, spread from bats to civet cats to humans. The South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou says that two of its researchers have identified the pangolin as the potential source of nCoV-2019. This was announced to reporters at a press conference on 7 February 2020.",

The JIT came to the conclusion that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy. At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was taken back to the Russian Federation. According to the JIT, the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17 originated from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. Based on the investigation conducted by JIT, the Dutch Public Prosecution service will prosecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of MH17 and murdering the 298 persons on board. The first session of the court proceedings started on March 9 2020 in the Netherlands. The European Union and NATO have\u00a0called on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and co-operate in order to establish accountability. On the basis of the JIT\u2019s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are formally holding Russia accountable for this disaster. The US has\u00a0supported\u00a0the decisions of the Netherlands and Australia. See similar cases like that the MH17 disaster was carefully planned by Ukraine and Western intelligence agencies and that the JIT chose to ignore Russian evidence of the MH17 crash.",

The pro-EU choice will bring no prospects for Ukraine because it stems from US and NATO\u2019s geopolitical ambitions rather than from Ukrainian people interests. Ukrainian authorities are completely dependent on Washington and Brussels. The US supported them in order to prevent good relations between Ukraine and Russia. By supporting fascists in Ukraine US and EU establishment uncover their undemocratic essence. Apparently, supporting neo-Nazis, antisemites and Russophobes in Ukraine is more important for the West than peace in Ukraine. Radical Ukrainian nationalists, together with radical Islamists, are becoming secret West\u2019s allies. The US brought fascism to Ukraine just as Nazi Germany did in WWII.",

It is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin propagandistic narratives about Ukraine ruled by Nazis / Fascists, Ukrainian politicians as West's puppets, West's anti-Russian activities, Russophobia in Ukraine, the West and beyond. It also puts forward ungrounded claim about radical Islamists as secret West's allies. Read our analyses The \u201cRussophobia\u201d Myth: Appealing to the Lowest Feelings and Nazi east, Nazi west, Nazi over the cuckoo's nest, which explain the prevalence of propagandistic narrative about Russophobia and accusations of Nazism. Ukraine is not controlled by any foreign government, while its sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected by most of the free world but were violated by Russia in 2014. The EU works closely with Ukraine and supports the democratic development of Ukraine in accordance with the UN Charter\u2019s principles of non-interference into internal affairs and respect towards territorial integrity and political independence. The US policy is focused on strengthening a stable, democratic, prosperous, and free Ukraine, more closely integrated into Europe and Euro-Atlantic structures. See earlier disinformation cases alleging that the US has turned Ukraine into a puppet, that the US State Department and US Embassy in Ukraine represent a system of \u201cGauleiter's\", that Ukraine is the largest arms supplier to Islamic extremists in Western Europe, and that the US and EU countries support Russophobic, neofascist, terrorist political parties and movements in the post-Soviet space.",

Sputnik Estonia journalists reported that they had previously received letters from the Estonian police and border guards that included direct threats to open lawsuits against them if they do not cut all work relations with the Russian news agency.",

Turkish police detained 4 journalists of Russia\u2019s Sputnik Turkiye news agency including editor-in-chief. According to the state-run news agency Anadolu, the journalists were \u201cbriefly detained\u201d for investigation in line with Turkish Penal Code for \"insulting the Turkish nation, Turkish republic and state institutions\", and \"disturbing the unity of the state and the solidarity of the country\u201d, \u00a0over a report on a disputed referendum that gave the southern province of Hatay to Turkey in 1939. This came as tensions between Ankara and Moscow, which support opposing sides in the war in Syria, have escalated as Russia-backed Syrian forces intensified their assault in Idlib. The 4 journalists were later released after a phone call between the foreign ministers of the two countries. European Federation of Journalists (EFJ) Secretary-General Ricardo Gutierrez was even quoted saying \u201cthese journalists were the victims of escalating diplomatic relations between Ankara and Moscow as a result of the ongoing war in Syria, particularly in Idlib province.\u201d On the other hand, in the case of Estonia where Sputnik is represented as a victim of unprecedented persecution, the country was just implementing economical sanctions on Russian companies, which are also valid for Sputnik, created by a Presidential decree. The steps taken by Estonia are based on Article 2 of the Council Regulation (EU) No 269/2014, which foresees freezing the assets of Dmitry Kiselyov, the Director-General of Rossiya Segodnya. As a result, Estonian banks froze accounts of Rossiya Segodnya and the Financial Intelligence Unit informed persons employed or contracted by Rossiya Segodnya that knowingly working for or providing services to a sanctioned person was forbidden. Estonia, which ranks 11th \u00a0in the Reporters without Borders Press freedom index, has not even blocked Sputnik Estonia's website. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Urmas Reinsalu has emphasised that Estonia has not taken any measures against the portal's media content nor its reporters. The agency has been forced to move out of its office in Tallinn because of its inability to pay the rent due to sanctions. In October 2019, Estonia-based branches of the foreign banks that operated the accounts of Rossiya Segodnya, the mother company of Sputnik, froze all its transfers, while other banks in Estonia refused to operate with the firm, which led to Sputnik Closing its Operations in Estonia.",

The Embassy of Norway did not recognise Mashchenko\u2019s passport, refused to issue a visa and offered him, as a citizen of Ukraine, to use Ukrainian biometric documents instead. At the same time, on February 27, during a meeting of the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna, the European Union once again emphasised that it would not recognise the occupation of Crimea or the \u201cRussian citizenship\u201d issued by the Kremlin on the peninsula.

In fact, in these two countries, as in others with a weak democracy, the George Soros Foundation promotes human rights. For instance, the Soros Foundation-Moldova was established in 1992 to promote the development of an open society in Moldova by developing and implementing a range of programs and activities that address specific areas of needs including media, justice and human rights, good governance, and public health. Also, the Open Society Foundation-Armenia has contributed over\u00a0$53 million\u00a0to Armenia since it began its work in 1997. Since then the foundation has supported a broad range of civil society groups, including women\u2019s shelters, investigative journalism outlets, human rights defenders, and organizations monitoring elections and public spending. George Soros is regularly accused by Russian media of controlling institutions, political groups, sexual minorities, refugees, but also of funding protests in several countries.",

Besides attacking Ukraine's legal reforms, which is one of several common disinformation strategies targeting Ukraine, it also attempts to paint the country as \"morally degenerate\" on LGBT issues, in line with one of the most common narratives used to attack Western values. The bill in question aims to improve the realization of rights for adolescents in the healthcare sector; it does not provide the rights to change sex. The main photo of the article, depicting children with LGBT flags is also deceptive. It was taken in Ireland in 2015 and has nothing to do with Ukraine.

Find similar cases here. Exercise Defender-Europe 2020 is the deployment of a division-size combat-credible force from the United States to Europe, the drawing of equipment and the movement of personnel and equipment across the theatre to various training areas. The aim of the exercises is to increase strategic readiness and interoperability by exercising the U.S. military\u2019s ability to rapidly deploy a large combat-credible force and equipment from the United States to Europe; and alongside its allies and partners, quickly respond to a potential crisis. \"The joint, multinational training exercise is scheduled to take place from April to May 2020, with personnel and equipment movements occurring from February through July 2020. The exercise supports objectives defined by NATO to build readiness within the alliance and deter potential adversaries. Approximately 37,000 U.S., allied, and partner nation service members are expected to participate with roughly 20,000 Soldiers deploying from the U.S,\" is noted on the official web site of the exercises. Eighteen countries are expected to participate, with exercise activities occurring across 10 countries. More details about the exercise can be found here. At a press conference in Berlin on January 14, 2020, the Deputy Commander of the US Armed Forces in Europe, General Andrew Rawling, announced that the Defender 2020 is not directed against Russia or against another country: \"These manoeuvres are not related to any particular country. In this, they differ from past exercises of the Cold War. It is a question of defence in general under various crisis scenarios.",

Two ladies stepped forward with accusations but no evidence. No material evidence, no witnesses, nothing was presented. In the best tradition of Stalinist trials, a media campaign was launched to turn an Oscar-winning victim into a disgusting beast, and reprisal against him had to be inevitable and demonstrative. Weinstein was subject to physical influence and was forced to chemically lower the level of his male hormone. The intimidation has made a strong man a sick man.",

            "content": "This case is in line with the Kremlin's ongoing disinformation efforts to paint the Western countries as morally degenerate, corrupting \"traditional\" values - in this case, viciously attacking masculinity. There is zero evidence to support the outlandish and baseless claim that Harvey Weinstein was subjected to physical influence and injected with a hormone suppressant. Harvey Weinstein, the former Hollywood producer whose history of sexual abuse was brought to light through the #MeToo movement, was convicted by a New York jury on 24 February 2020 on two of five charges: a criminal sex act in the first degree and rape in the third degree. The jury of seven men and five women at the New York supreme court took five days to reach their verdict, finding Weinstein guilty of a criminal sex act in the first degree for forcing oral sex on the former Project Runway production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006, and rape in the third degree of an unnamed woman in a New York hotel in 2013. Weinstein was acquitted of three further charges, including the two most serious counts of predatory sexual assault - which carried a possible life sentence - and an alternative count of rape in the first degree. The prosecutors called 27 witnesses over 12 days, with six women testifying against Weinstein. The timeline of the trial is available here. Weinstein's sentencing is scheduled for March 11. The Stalinist show trials were a campaign of terror carried out through the late 1920s-30s against Soviet citizens deemed enemies of the party. Known as the \u201cGreat Terror\u201d or the \u201cGreat Purge,\u201d the Soviet secret police arrested millions of people, including government officials, scientists, artists, and writers. Hundreds of thousands were executed or died while in labor camps throughout the country in the purges of 1936-1938.",

            "content": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative portraying NATO and its members as a threat to global peace because of their aggressive military agenda. The essential mission of the Czech Armed Forces is to prepare for the defence of the Czech Republic and to defend it against external attacks (see the Defence Strategy of the Czech Republic). Contrary to the claim above, the Czech Army is preparing for external expansion as a result of NATO membership. Like all NATO members, which have joined the alliance as a result of their own sovereign national choice, the Czech Republic considers its membership in NATO as a vital guarantee for its freedom and national security. Read more about the defence policy of the Czech Army here - Long Term Perspective for Defence 2035. NATO's purpose is to protect its members. Its exercises and military deployments are not directed against Russia or any other country. The claim that NATO is encircling or threatening Russia is one of the common pro-Kremlin disinformation myths about the alliance. NATO\u00a0 regularly updates the military requirements for civilian infrastructure, at a time when there are increased challenges to security. Following Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and amid emerging security challenges in the Middle East and North Africa in 2014, NATO leaders at the Wales Summit adopted the\u00a0Readiness\u00a0Action Plan, a comprehensive package of enhanced collective defence and deterrent measures designed to ensure the transatlantic alliance could respond swiftly and firmly to changes in its security environment. See several other anti-NATO narratives such as NATO\u00a0provoking Russia; NATO being fully subordinated\u00a0to the USA; Eastern European countries as NATO \u201chostages\u201d (Baltic\u00a0states,\u00a0Moldova,\u00a0Poland).",

According to innovations, citizens of Ukraine can cross the border with Russia only with a biometric passport for travelling abroad. Before, Ukrainians used to travel to Russia with an internal passport. According to Ukrainian legislation and international standards, the annexed Crimea, as well as the occupied territories of Donbas, is the territory of Ukraine. The State Border Service of Ukraine confirmed that the new rule applies exclusively to the state border with Russia and does not in any way affect the administrative border between Ukraine and the temporarily occupied territories. In addition, after the annexation of Crimea and the occupation of part of Donbas, Ukraine adopted a number of laws protecting the rights of Ukrainians living there. Ukraine does not recognise the occupation of its territories, nor the forced acquisition of Russian citizenship in the occupied territories (article 5, paragraph 4).",

Many countries have so far been affected by the new virus. The\u00a0World Health Organisation is working with global experts to combat the virus. To boost global preparedness, prevention and containment of the virus the EU announced an aid package worth \u20ac232 million.

The onset of the Euromaidan protests was a spontaneous and endogenous reaction by numerous segments of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych\u2019s sudden withdrawal from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. The protesters\u2019 demands included constitutional reform, a stronger role for parliament, the formation of a government of national unity, an end to corruption, early presidential elections and an end to violence. See the full debunk of this disinformation claim\u00a0here. Regarding the claim about Ukraine's economy being disastrous, according to the World Bank, the GDP of Ukraine grew by 3.5% in the first half of 2019, compared to 3.3% in 2018. The solid growth was driven by a strong agricultural harvest, as well as sectors dependent on domestic demand, including services (domestic trade, transport, and the financial sector) and construction. In 2019, the GDP of Ukraine was US$130.832 billion. Thirty years ago it was $82.709 billion, an increase of over 50 percent.

The\u00a0Munich Agreement (signed 30 September 1938), did indeed permit German annexation of the Sudetenland, in western Czechoslovakia. The policy of appeasement towards Adolf Hitler was heavily criticised in Europe and proved to be a disastrous move. World War II began in Europe on 1 September 1939, when Germany invaded Poland, knowing that the Soviet Union did not oppose them and would also invade Poland from the east. Great Britain and France responded by declaring war on Germany on 3 September. The\u00a0\"Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact\"\u00a0was accompanied by a\u00a0secret supplementary protocol\u00a0on the delimitation of areas of mutual interest in Eastern Europe. In particular, Hitler and Stalin agreed to divide Poland. The agreement also indicated that the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, as well as Bessarabia and Finland, also belonged to the respective areas of interest of Germany and the USSR. Just a week after the signing of the Pact, the German attack on Poland started World War II. Two weeks later, Soviet troops entered Polish territory.

            "content": "This is the Kremlin\u2019s systematic disinformation campaign that Ukraine is a Nazi state. Negative articles in Russian media are caused by Ukraine\u2019s refusal to take part in the celebrations of the \"75th Anniversary of the Great Victory\" in Moscow. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko emphasised that Ukraine intends to grieve on this day instead of celebrating. \u201cOur position now remains the way it is: no, we are not going to celebrate May 9. We, like the entire European continent, are ready to understand why this tragedy happened 75 years later and are ready to forgive each other,\u201d Prystaiko said. Since 2015, in the framework of the law on decommunisation, on May 9, Ukraine began to celebrate \"Victory Day over Nazism in World War II of 1939-1945.\" The holiday replaced the \"Victory Day\" over fascism in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945\".\u00a0 The relevant law No. 2539 \u201cOn the Perpetuation of the Victory over Nazism in World War II of 1939 - 1945\u201d was adopted on April 9, 2015, by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. The law defines the sacred duty of the state and citizens of Ukraine to respect the memory of the victory over Nazism in WWII: war veterans, members of the Ukrainian liberation movement and the victims of Nazism. At the same time, while respecting the memory of those who fell during WWII, the use of Soviet symbols was cancelled. Instead, now the official symbol of the celebration of the Day of Victory over Nazism in WWII is the red poppy flower - the generally accepted symbol in the world for the celebration of memorable days of WWII. Also, together with the EU countries, on May 8, Ukraine annually celebrates Remembrance and Reconciliation Day. The holiday is celebrated on the day of the surrender of Nazi Germany on May 8, 1945.",

It also uses allegations of Nazism, which is a common trope in pro-Kremlin disinformation. The coronavirus (2019-nCoV) comes from a family of viruses originating in animals that include other viruses such as SARS and MERS. It was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in central China and has been rapidly spreading with new cases being reported in the Asia-Pacific region as well as Europe, North America and the Middle East. Coronavirus is confirmed in 110 countries, including the US. It is also a conspiracy theory that HIV was created in a laboratory - this story is in line with one of the most famous cases of anti-American disinformation planted by the Soviet Union, Operation Infektion, which alleged that HIV was created and weaponised by the CIA. Read about the origins of HIV here. There are numerous similar cases about the coronavirus pushed by pro-Kremlin media, for example that it is an artificial disease\u00a0which specifically\u00a0targets Chinese DNA, that it was created\u00a0with economic goals\u00a0while\u00a0big pharma companies\u00a0are spreading panic for their own profit, that it is a biological weapon\u00a0against Russia and China, that the virus is a Western tool to attack the Chinese economy, and that\u00a0it is a US provocation against China.",

            "content": "Recurring narrative of a Western-led plot to spread the Coronavirus. The article quotes a little known expert from Russia\u2019s Baltic fleet with the aim of fueling a conspiracy by drawing an unfounded link between the conduct of NATO\u2019s DEFENDER Europe-20 military exercise with an ulterior motive to spread a Coronavirus pandemic in Europe as the fastest way of being able to neutralise Russian forces. There is no evidence that suggests that the coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is used as a weapon against other states. It comes from a family of viruses that include other viruses such as SARS and MERS. It was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in central China and has been rapidly spreading with new cases being reported in the Asia-Pacific region as well as Europe, North America and the Middle East, causing more than 3584 deaths by 08 March 2020. As of 8th March 2020, coronavirus was confirmed in over 100 countries in all continents (except Antarctica). The identity of the animal source of the coronavirus, named nCoV-2019, has been one of the key questions for the researchers. Coronaviruses are known to circulate in mammals and birds, and scientists have already suggested that nCoV-2019 originally came from bats. One of the previous coronaviruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, spread from bats to civet cats to humans. The South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou says that two of its researchers have identified the pangolin as the potential source of nCoV-2019. This was announced to reporters at a press conference on 7 February 2020.",

He explained that [Ukrainian president Petro] Poroshenko was a US puppet, and that a foreign government came and carried out a coup in the presidential elections.

For this reason, the US interfered in Ukraine\u2019s internal affairs and started a war in Eastern Ukraine. Donbas\u2019 citizens had no alternative but to take up weapons in face of what was basically an invasion of their country.",

The demonstrations against Yanukovych, which began in Kyiv in November 2013, called \"Maidan\", or \"Euromaidan\",\u00a0 were a result of the Ukrainian people's frustration with the president\u2019s last-minute U-turn when, after seven years of negotiation, he refused to sign the EU\u2013Ukraine Association Agreement and halted progress towards Ukraine's closer relationship with the EU as a result of Russian pressure. When those protests were met with government-led police violence, they became massive, ultimately resulting in Yanukovych\u2019s fall. There is zero evidence of any foreign implication behind the demonstrations. On the contrary, proof of Russia\u2019s involvement in fomenting unrest in Eastern Ukraine and in creating a military conflict has been mounting since an early stage. You can see other examples of disinformation narratives in Ukraine in our database, such as claims that the Maidan protests were a coup orchestrated by foreign secret services through neo-nazi groups aiming to bring oligarchs to power (and that the US has allegedly admitted it), that Russia is no part of Ukraine\u2019s conflict, that it was the Ukrainians who downed the MH17 flight, or that there is no such a thing as a Ukrainian nation different from Russia.",

            "content": "While it is true that Russian Forces imposed their control on government institutions in Crimea by force, the latter narrative is recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation on the annexation of Crimea\u00a0claiming that Crimean citizens chose to rejoin Russia through a\u00a0legal referendum and that Crimea has never belonged to Ukraine. The transfer of Crimea and Sevastopol to Ukraine was first officially agreed on 25 January 1954 at a meeting of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee. The members of the Presidium, voting for the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine, took into account objective reasons: \u201cthe commonality of the economy, territorial proximity and close economic and cultural ties between the Crimean region and the Ukrainian SSR.\u201d On 19 February 1954, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR confirmed the need for Crimea to join Soviet Ukraine. Legally, the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine ended on 26 April 1954, on the basis of the relevant law of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. According to international law, Crimea is a part of Ukraine. After the collapse of the USSR, Russia reaffirmed respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. By signing the\u00a01997 Friendship Treaty, Russia also recognised that Crimea is an integral part of Ukraine. No international body recognises the so-called referendum, announced on the 27th of February 2014, and held on 16th of March 2014. A year after the illegal annexation, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u00a0admitted\u00a0that the plan to annex Crimea was ordered weeks before the so-called referendum. The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court\u00a0has stated that \u201cthe situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. This international armed conflict began at the latest on 26 February 2014 when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of \u00a0Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government\". On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a\u00a0resolution\u00a0in which it stated that the referendum in Crimea was\u00a0not valid\u00a0and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly\u00a0confirmed\u00a0its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea. The EU's\u00a0policy of non-recognition\u00a0of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol includes a set of restrictive measures against entities and individuals responsible for actions against Ukraine's territorial integrity.\u00a0In March 2019, on the fifth anniversary of Crimea'sannexation,\u00a0the EU reiterated its position of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol. The EU continues to stand in full solidarity with Ukraine, supporting its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Read similar cases claiming that\u00a0Crimean people have expressed their desire to rejoin Russia in a democratic process\u00a0and that\u00a0Crimea never belonged to Ukraine.",

The final decision was made in January 2019, when all members of the Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate signed off\u00a0the Tomos of autocephaly. The signing of the Tomos happened after months of careful\u00a0preparations and considerations by the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and the Holy Synod. In October 2018, the Holy Synod decided to revoke the letter of 1686 by which it gave the right to the Moscow patriarchy \"to consecrate the ecclesiastical subordinates of Constantinople in Kyiv Metropolitanate, interpreted by the Russian Church as its transfer to Moscow.\" For similar cases, see here.",

The virus is carefully chosen, reaching countries that are the opponents of the United States of America, such as China and Iran, and some countries of the European Union such as Italy, which has tendencies towards Russia. Suspiciously, just 3 months after the virus was discovered in December, the United States announced reaching a vaccine for the Coronavirus. This period is unreasonable, so it can be said that they most likely had a vaccine prior to the outbreak. Stock markets around the world were all affected, except American markets. There is information that the Israeli authorities have built a biological weapon that targets only the Palestinians. In Madagascar, there was a pneumonic plague spread, which killed only locals but didn\u2019t affect European tourists nor the yellow race. The Anglo-Saxon countries provided a biological warning to all non-English speaking countries: \u201cEither you live according to our laws , or you will not live on this planet.

The narratives also resemble a recurring conspiracy theory about the\u00a0Lugar Lab\u00a0in Georgia. Apart from the American soldiers, there were, in fact, 17 teams with over 280 athletes and staff in the Military World Games that was held from October 18\u201327, 2019 in the capital of Hubei Province in Wuhan. The Coronavirus started to spread 65 days after the closing ceremony\u00a0of the Military World Games, and so far there is no evidence to prove any connection between the two events. Furthermore, a group of 27 prominent public health scientists, from nine countries, wrote a statement published online\u00a0by\u00a0The Lancet, that \"strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin\", and they \u201coverwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife,\u201d just like many other viruses that have recently emerged in humans.",

In Latvia, they have a cult of the Latvian SS division. This Nazification process has the most advanced character in Ukraine. The strategic interest of the USA is to spread its influence in Eastern Europe in order to construct in this region its military bases and sell expensive arms (such as F-35) \u2013 that is why it is necessary to promote all possible Russophobic forces. Hitler\u2019s collaborators are promoted within this strategy.",

Find similar cases here. Exercise Defender-Europe 2020\u00a0is the deployment of a division-size combat-credible force from the United States to Europe, the drawing of equipment and the movement of personnel and equipment across the theatre to various training areas. The aim of the exercises is to increase strategic readiness and interoperability by exercising the U.S. military\u2019s ability to rapidly deploy a large combat-credible force and equipment from the United States to Europe; and alongside its allies and partners, quickly respond to a potential crisis. \"The joint, multinational training exercise is scheduled to take place from April to May 2020, with personnel and equipment movements occurring from February through July 2020. The exercise supports objectives defined by NATO to build readiness within the alliance and deter potential adversaries. Approximately 37,000 U.S., allied, and partner nation service members are expected to participate with roughly 20,000 Soldiers deploying from the U.S,\" is noted on the\u00a0official web site\u00a0of the exercises. Eighteen countries are expected to participate, with exercise activities occurring across 10 countries. More details about the exercise can be found\u00a0here. At a\u00a0press conference in Berlin on January 14, 2020, the Deputy Commander of the US Armed Forces in Europe, General Andrew Rawling, announced that the Defender 2020 is not directed against Russia or against another country: \"These manoeuvres are not related to any particular country. In this, they differ from past exercises of the Cold War. It is a question of defence in general under various crisis scenarios.",

Pro-Kremlin media routinely accuse the White Helmets of \u201cworking for terrorists\u201d and being a creation of the Western intelligence services. No evidence is given to support these claims. The \"White Helmets\" movement originated in Syria in 2012. The organisation, which is made up of 3,400\u00a0volunteers including teachers, engineers, tailors and firefighters, states\u00a0that it has\u00a0no affiliation to any political or military actor and is committed to rendering services to anyone in need. Volunteers save people from the rubble after bombings, despite the danger of dying themselves as a result of repeated air strikes. White Helmets' activists have documented the use of chemical weapons in Syria, later confirmed by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\u00a0 (OPCW). Thus, OPCW said it found reasonable grounds to believe that chlorine was used as a weapon in the Douma district of Eastern Ghouta, Syria in April 2018. Because of its activities, the White Helmets have become the target of an extensive Russian disinformation campaign. Read previous disinformation claims alleging that France, UK, and the US support terrorists in Syria, that evidence confirms chemical attacks in Syria were falsified by the White Helmets, and that the chemical attacks in Syria have been staged and filmed by the media of the Western countries.",

See more examples of groundless statements about the coronavirus\u00a0here. A preprint scientific manuscript published Jan. 31 by a group of Indian researchers suggested that the virus, known as COVID-19, may have been deliberately engineered using the HIV. The findings, which fed conspiracy theories that the new virus might be a bioweapon, have sparked a huge controversy. The authors withdrew the paper on Feb. 2 from the bioRxiv preprint server. A group of 27 prominent public health scientists condemn rumors and conspiracy theories about origin of coronavirus outbreak. \"We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.The authors of\u00a0The Lancet\u00a0statement note that\u00a0scientists from several countries who have studied SARS-CoV-2 \u201coverwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, just like many other viruses that have recently emerged in humans. Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumors, and prejudice that jeopardize our global collaboration in the fight against this virus, the statement says. The current\u00a0coronavirus (2019-nCoV) comes from a family of viruses that include other viruses such as SARS and MERS. The identity of the animal source of the coronavirus, named nCoV-2019, has been one of the key questions for the researchers. Coronaviruses are known to circulate in mammals and birds, and scientists have already suggested that nCoV-2019 originally came from bats. One of the previous coronaviruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, spread from bats to civet cats to humans. See other cases claiming that Coronavirus is a tool to weaken Chinese economy, Coronavirus is an attempt by the Anglo_saxons to control China.",

On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a\u00a0resolution\u00a0in which it stated that the referendum in Crimea was\u00a0not valid\u00a0and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly\u00a0confirmed\u00a0its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea. According to international law, Crimea is a part of Ukraine. Russia violated international law as well as key principles of the European security framework by\u00a0illegally annexing\u00a0the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol in 2014.",

Britain and France, standing by their guarantee of Poland's border, had declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939, being the first countries to do so, taking such a decision two days after the invasion of Poland. France and Britain, at that time, were the only remaining countries to be part of the League of Nations. France was then suspended from the League of Nations, until the recognition of the French Committee of National Liberation in October 1944 (after the beginning of the negotiations about the UN), France then became a candidate to be part of the UN's Security Council. Thus, even though De Gaulle was not invited to the Yalta Conference, France's participation in the Security Council was supported by Britain, according to Pierre Gerbet in his book \"The birth of the United Nations\", and France\u00a0was allocated an occupation zone in Germany, to be carved out from the British and American zones, upon British insistence. Stalin agreed with this decision on a single condition: the zones which will be given to France wouldn't be the ones of the USSR.",

The UN-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism found Syria\u2019s Government responsible for the April 2017 attack in Khan Shaykhun. On April 2018, Russia vetoed a US-drafted UN Security Council resolution that would have created a new inquiry to ascertain responsibility for chemical weapons attacks in Syria. In June 2018, the OPCW members granted it the power to assign responsibility for chemical attacks.\u00a0 Read more about the \u201calleged\u201d usage of chemical weapons in Douma.

The official position of Poland, Ukraine and the Baltic states regarding WWII is based on facts, shared by the predominant majority of historians. Both Nazi Germany\u00a0and the\u00a0Stalinist USSR\u00a0were harsh totalitarian regimes, which directly caused the deaths of tens of millions of people. Secondly, these two regimes are mutually responsible for the outbreak of WWII. It is a\u00a0fact\u00a0that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the\u00a0Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of WWII. See similar examples of the Russian accusations against Poland, Ukraine and the Baltic states in falsification and re-writing of history -\u00a0Poland creates and promotes its historical myths in an active and aggressive way; Poland and Lithuania question the status of Russia as a country who won WWII; President Duda and President Zelensky promote propaganda and Poland tries to adjust history to politics, misinterpreting the historical facts.",

            "content": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative aiming to discredit the International Joint Investigation (JIT) into the downing of flight\u00a0MH17. The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) - which is comprised of the Dutch Public Prosecution Service officials and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy. At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was\u00a0taken\u00a0back to the Russian Federation. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17 originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, the Dutch Public Persecution service will persecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of MH17 and murdering the 298 persons on board. The public hearing is\u00a0scheduled for 9 March 2020 in the Netherlands. The European Union and NATO have\u00a0called\u00a0on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability. On the basis of the JIT\u2019s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the BUK installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are\u00a0formally\u00a0holding Russia accountable. Read other disinformation narratives alleging that The Netherlands is going to sabotage the MH17 trial, The MH17 trial will be a show process, and that There was no BUK, MH17 crashed because of an explosion on board.",

Such a bloody local history. Muddle instead of the state. There are Borscht, [Stepan] Bandera, there is the bandura. But there is no nation. There is a brochure \u201cIndependent Ukraine\u201d, but there is no Ukraine. The only question is, has Ukraine already gone, or has it not yet emerged? Ukraine has not yet emerged. But over time, it will appear. Ukrainians are stubborn guys, they will carry it out. However, what kind of Ukraine will it be, in what borders will it exist, and even, maybe, how many Ukraines there will be is an open question. And one way or another, Russia will have to participate in resolving these issues. Relations with Ukraine were never simple, even when Ukraine was part of Russia. Ukraine has always been troublesome for the imperial and Soviet bureaucracy. Coercion by force to fraternal relations is the only method that has historically proven effective in the Ukrainian direction.",

Before the Mueller report was published, Russian meddling in the 2016 election had already been\u00a0established by US intelligence agencies. Thus, the Special Investigation was\u00a0primarily concerned\u00a0with \"whether any Americans [\u2026] joined the Russian conspiracies to influence the election\" (p.2). Robert Mueller makes it clear in his report\u00a0that \"collusion\" is not a legal concept under US federal law, and that gathering evidence thereof would have fallen outside the scope of the special counsel investigation (p. 2). The report does, in fact, identify \"numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign\" (p. 9). The investigation ascertained that \"Russia's two principal interference operations [\u2026] violated US criminal law\" (p. 9) and were carried out in \"sweeping and systematic fashion\" (p. 1), noting that 13 Russian nationals implicated in these operations have been charged with \"conspiracy to defraud the United States\" (p. 174). Robert Mueller is a Republican appointed by the Trump administration, tasked with investigating ties between President Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian officials.",

            "content": "This message is part of the Kremlin\u2019s policy of\u00a0historical revisionism and an attempt to portray Russia's role in World War II as not aggressive. Recently, pro-Kremlin media has been actively spreading various disinformation messages about the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The\u00a0European Parliament resolution on the importance of European remembrance for the future of Europe stressed the fact that WWII was an immediate result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The resolution is aimed at the promotion of historical remembrance about WWII and condemnation of totalitarian ideologies. It is a fact\u00a0that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the\u00a0Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of WWII. See similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning this issue such as the\u00a0Signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact thwarted the UK\u2019s expansionist plans in Europe,\u00a0The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact did not violate the rights of the Polish state,\u00a0The shift of all blame for WWII outbreak at the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact the best example of manipulation of history.",

            "content": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative denying Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. Before the Mueller report was published, Russian meddling in the 2016 election had already been\u00a0established by US intelligence agencies. Thus, the Special Investigation was\u00a0primarily concerned\u00a0with \"whether any Americans [\u2026] joined the Russian conspiracies to influence the election\" (p.2). Robert Mueller makes clear in his\u00a0report\u00a0that \"collusion\" is not a legal concept under US federal law, and that gathering evidence thereof would have fallen outside the scope of the special counsel investigation (p. 2). The report does, in fact, identify \"numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign\" (p. 9). Given its focus on the\u00a0criminal\u00a0component of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential poll, Mueller's team did not aim to assess the impact of these campaigns on US voter behaviour. The investigation ascertained that \"Russia's two principal interference operations [\u2026] violated US criminal law\" (p. 9) and were carried out in \"sweeping and systematic fashion\" (p. 1), noting that 13 Russian nationals implicated in these operations have been charged with \"conspiracy to defraud the United States\" (p. 174). The claim that the meddling allegations were used to excuse Hillary Clinton's loss defies both time and logic. Efforts by Moscow to hurt the Clinton campaign were reported already in June 2016, some five months before her electoral defeat. The initial FBI probe into Russian interference operations was launched in late July 2016. It is therefore unclear how these revelations were meant to \"excuse\" Clinton's performance before election day, seeing as she commanded a decisive polling lead over Trump right up until 8 November. Voter fraud in the United States is a non-issue.\u00a0Out of 136,669,276 ballots cast on 8 November, a grand total of four were identified as fraudulent. None of the four votes was included in official tallies. For similar cases, see here.",

The virus \"2019-nCoV\u201d comes from a family of viruses that include the common cold, and viruses such as\u00a0SARS\u00a0and\u00a0MERS. Western media are not controlled by the government and do not run coordinated propagandistic campaigns on government orders to harm China or some other country. A high degree of media freedom in Western countries is reflected in the top ranks these countries occupy in respective world rankings including the World Press Freedom Index by Reporters without Borders. Read earlier disinformation cases alleging that coronavirus is the West\u2019s revenge for China refusing to become hostile towards Russia, that Amnesty International is an ideological tool of the US security services, and that the Luciferian Zionist Rothschild crime family controls the Western mainstream media.",

            "content": "Conspiracy theory about the 2019-nCoV coronavirus,\u00a0based\u00a0on recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the biological weapons and the Lugar Lab in Georgia. The current\u00a0coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\u00a0comes from a family of viruses that include other viruses such as SARS and MERS.\u00a0It was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in central China and has been rapidly spreading with new cases being reported in the Asia-Pacific region as well as Europe, North America and the Middle East, causing more than 700 deaths by 10 February 2020. The identity of the animal source of the coronavirus, named nCoV-2019, has been one of the key questions for the researchers. Coronaviruses are known to circulate in mammals and birds, and scientists have already suggested that nCoV-2019 originally came from bats. One of the previous coronaviruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, spread from bats to civet cats to humans. The South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou says that two of its researchers have identified the pangolin as the potential source of nCoV-2019. This was announced to reporters at a press conference on 7 February 2020. Read similar disinformation cases: the US prepares biological weapons, the US is constructing secret biological labs, and a new Chinese coronavirus was likely elaborated in NATO Biolabs.",

Reporters Without Borders, also known as Reporters Sans Fronti\u00e8res (RSF), is a leading international non-profit and non-governmental organisation that safeguards the right to freedom of information. Its mandate is to promote free, independent and pluralistic journalism and to defend media workers. In\u00a0Estonia,\u00a0Sputnik is represented as a victim of unprecedented persecution.\u00a0This kind of statements were debunked several times (read more here). The steps taken by Estonia are based on the Article 2 of the Council\u00a0Regulation\u00a0(EU)\u00a0No\u00a0269/2014\u00a0on the territorial integrity of Ukraine that foresees freezing the assets of Dmitry Kiselyov, the Director-General of Rossija Segodnya. As for the freedom of speech, Estonia is indeed\u00a0on the 11th place\u00a0of Reporters without Borders Press freedom index. It's important to note that Estonia has not blocked Sputnik Estonia's website, as it is accessible and operational. The Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu has emphasized that Estonia has\u00a0not taken any measures against the portal's media content: \"They are financial sanctions aimed at economic activity. I believe it to be justified. We have notified the European Commission's Legal Service. European agencies have said in the Commission that steps taken by Estonia in exercising sanctions policy are warranted.\" Sputnik\u00a0was created\u00a0by\u00a0a Presidential decree\u00a0with the aim to \u201creport on the state policy of Russia abroad\u201d.\u00a0Numerous reports\u00a0have described how\u00a0top managers\u00a0from all the large government-controlled outlets and some influential private media\u00a0attend the weekly meetings where\u00a0\"media managers\u00a0receive guidelines\u00a0that \u201chelp\u201d them not to overstep the Kremlin\u2019s so-called \u201cdouble white lines\u201d\".",

In February 2020, US intelligence officers warned lawmakers that about Russia was to help both Donald Trump and Democratic aspiring candidate Bernie Sanders. Some of these attempts were widely documented by social media investigations company Graphika in a report published in October 2019. Contrary to the claim of the article, there are many reasons why Russia may want to do this, from increasing US polarisation to deepen divisions inside the Democratic Party to sowing mistrust on democracy. This is part of a recurrent pro-Kremlin narrative denying Russia\u2019s interference in foreign elections despite overwhelming evidence, both in the US and in other countries. You can see other examples of disinformation about this subject, such as allegations that neither the US Intelligence Committee report nor the Mueller report found any evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 US elections, that there is no proof that Russia tried to influence the Brexit referendum or about the role played by RT and Sputnik in these and other processes, that \u201cabsurd\u201d accusations against Russia are an attempt to demonise it, or that the US and UK are indeed the ones who try to interfere in Europe.",

The article combines several pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives: that the West is using feminist and gender theories to destabilise societies, and that the\u00a0US and other Western states are supporting and using jihadist groups to advance geopolitical goals. There is no evidence to support the claim that the US and other Western governments use gender theories to undermine other governments and promote \u201ccolour revolutions\u201d. Gender theories are a product of contemporary social science and culture. They are not political and ideological weapons. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the US or other Western governments and their intelligence services have supported radical Islamist terrorist groups in any region of the world. On the contrary, ever since the September 11 terrorist attacks the US and its allies have been engaged in enormous military and intelligence efforts to counter Al Qaeda, ISIS and other radical Islamist terrorist groups around the world. Read similar cases claiming that feminist and gender theories are used by the West to undermine the cultures and the governments of countries based on traditional patriarchal values and that the US uses its religious sects to undermine the religious foundation of other societies, provoke mass protests and coup d\u2019etat attempts across the globe.",

The increase in popularity of Euroscepticism due to the migration crisis posed a challenge to the EU\u2019s existence. To address it, Brussels took Russophobia as a cementing idea. Lately it has taken the form of history falsifications, especially when it comes to WWII. Following Brexit, only those countries remain in the EU which either fought against the USSR with Hitler, or supported the Nazis economically. Since at the moment of the Nazi Germany invasion against the USSR in 1941, the largest European economies were under Germany, the USSR was de facto attacked by a united Europe headed by Adolf Hitler.",

It is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin propaganda narratives about ubiquitous Russophobia. Read our analysis: The \u201cRussophobia\u201d Myth: Appealing to the Lowest Feelings and look at earlier disinformation cases, alleging that Russophobia is the main activity of the Latvian state\u00a0and that Russophobic Lithuania plans to tear Belarus away from Russia by dragging it into the Western energy network. The message also uses the accusation of Nazism and alleged association to Hitler, which is one of the commonly used techniques of pro-Kremlin outlets, as explained in our past analysis. The EU does not face a threat of collapse as alleged. Support for the EU, as shown in 2019 Eurobarometer poll, remains at historically high levels. Continued support for EU membership goes with a strong belief (68%) that EU countries overall have benefited from being part of the EU \u2013 equalling the highest level recorded since 1983, as communicated by the European Parliament's Press. Read earlier disinformation cases alleging that neo-Nazism flourishes in the European Union and that the Baltic states\u2019 policies equal to Third Reich whereas Russophobia has become a Western value.",

While many baseless conspiracy theories\u00a0emerged all over the world amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, there is no proof that Ukrainian media or even Ukrainian trolls are deliberately promoting them targeting Russia. On the other hand, there is mounting evidence\u00a0that pro-Kremlin media are spreading disinformation on the disease\u00a0for political purposes\u00a0in a\u00a0coordinated campaign. Cases of a new coronavirus have been detected in more than 20 countries, including Russia.

The fact that some lawyers worked at some point in their career for an NGO that received funds from the Open Society Foundation before becoming a judge for the ECHR is not sufficient to declare a potential conflict of interest. The recruitment process for judges to the ECHR is as follows; each member state of the Council of Europe proposes three candidates, from whom one is elected for a 9 years non-renewable mandate. This ensures the diversity of the court. Georges Soros is regularly accused by Russian backed media of controlling institutions, governments, the Ukrainian President, the Pope, European Commission and European central bank, or on the contrary, aiming to destabilise the European Union\u00a0or wanting\u00a0some governments to collapse.",

Ukraine is recognised in international law as a\u00a0sovereign nation-state, with its own flag, nationality, language and with a democratically-elected president and parliament. The EU and the US support the democratic development of Ukraine in accordance with the UN Charter\u2019s principles of non-interference into internal affairs and respect towards territorial integrity and political independence. There was no coup d'\u00e9tat in Ukraine. The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests\u00a0was an organic reaction\u00a0by numerous segments of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych\u2019s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. The war in eastern Ukraine is not a civil conflict but a well-documented\u00a0act of aggression by Russian armed forces, ongoing since February 2014.",

It represents recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about alleged Western \"Russophobia\" and the coronavirus being a man-made tool of warfare. While many baseless conspiracy theories have emerged amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, there is no evidence that Western media are deliberately promoting them with malign intent. There is no evidence of any reputable Western media outlet describing coronavirus as a 'Kremlin project'. On the other hand, there is mounting evidence\u00a0that pro-Kremlin media are spreading disinformation on the disease\u00a0for political purposes through a coordinated campaign. Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) comes from a family of viruses originating in animals that include other viruses such as SARS and MERS. It was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in central China and has been rapidly spreading with new cases being reported in the Asia-Pacific region as well as Europe, North America and the Middle East, causing more than 3584 deaths by 8 March 2020. As of 8th March 2020, coronavirus was confirmed in over 100 countries on all continents (except Antarctica). Coronaviruses are known to circulate in mammals and birds, and scientists have already suggested that nCoV-2019 originally came from bats. The South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou says that two of its researchers have identified the pangolin as the potential source of nCoV-2019. This was announced to reporters at a press conference on 7 February 2020. Read previous disinformation narratives alleging that the emergence of the coronavirus is not accidental and has economic goals, that the coronavirus is a US provocation against China, that the coronavirus is a biological weapon created by the UK, and that a new Chinese coronavirus was likely elaborated in NATO biolabs.",

Ukraine filed a lawsuit against Russia on 16 September 2016, concerning the Kremlin's violations of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea in the Kerch Strait and the Sea of \u200b\u200bAzov. The Kremlin appealed that the Permanent Court of Arbitration does not have jurisdiction to consider this case, but the court rejected Russia's objections on 21 February 2020 and determined it would hear Ukraine's claims. Ukraine insists in its lawsuit that since 2014, Russia has hindered Ukraine from using natural resources from its own marine areas: including fish resources and huge oil and gas reserves. Also, that Russia impedes free navigation through the Kerch Strait. The Permanent Court of Arbitration did reject one of Ukraine's claims, concerning the rights of the country as a coastal state in waters near the Crimea. Nevertheless, the court did not in any way confirm the \u201cRussian status of Crimea\u201d. The Permanent Court of Arbitration is not authorised to consider the issue of the occupation of the Ukrainian peninsula, but it was able to rule on territorial waters, stressing that \"the tribunal cannot question the sovereignty of Ukraine over the Crimea.\" The International Criminal Court in The Hague will consider the case of the occupation of Crimea and a formal investigation into the annexation of the peninsula this year, according to the prosecutor's office of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. Ukraine has filed seven appeals with the International Criminal Court, which are considered by Dutch prosecutors.",

            "content": "This is a conspiracy which is consistent with a recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about the West's intentions to disrupt Belarusian-Russian relations. It also depicts the 2013-14 protests in Kyiv as a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat orchestrated by the West and presents wide-spread anti-Russian sentiments among Ukrainians as aggressive Western actions rather than the result of Russian military involvement in Eastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea. The narrative denies Russian military involvement in Donbas while there is irrefutable evidence of direct Russian military involvement\u00a0in Eastern Ukraine.\u00a0The EU has condemned the clear\u00a0violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces\u00a0since February 2014. There was no coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Ukraine. The onset of the Euromaidan protests was a spontaneous and endogenous reaction by numerous segments of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych\u2019s sudden withdrawal from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. The protesters\u2019 demands included constitutional reform, a stronger role for parliament, the formation of a government of national unity, an end to corruption, early presidential elections and an end to violence. See the full debunk of this disinformation claim\u00a0here. The publication uses a derogatory term 'Little Russians' to identify Ukrainians, which derives from imperial Russian and Russian irredentist ideology that is a favoured pro-Kremlin narrative aimed at weakening the national identity of Ukrainians and undermining Ukraine's sovereignty. Belarusians and Ukrainians are not part of Russian people as alleged, Belarus and Ukraine are well-defined nation-states with a long history, which preserved language, literature and identity, despite foreign rule for long periods. See earlier disinformation cases alleging that the West is targeting the Union State between Belarus and Russia, that Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine are three Russian political nations, and that the West's objective is to encircle Russia entirely thanks to the \"Anaconda ring\" and \"Great Turan\" doctrines.",

According to this policy, the Russian official historiography is the only \u201ctrue\u201d way of interpretation of historical events for the countries of Eastern and Central Europe. The Polish historical policy is based on objective historical facts, shared by the predominant majority of mainstream historians. First of all, it is an undeniable historical fact that both\u00a0Nazi Germany\u00a0and the\u00a0Stalinist USSR were harsh totalitarian regimes, which directly caused the deaths of tens of millions of people. Secondly, these two regimes are mutually responsible for the outbreak of WWII. It is a fact\u00a0that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the\u00a0Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of WWII. In 1944-1945 the USSR occupied Poland, establishing the undemocratic and repressive Communist Poland. Poland was kept under the Soviet\u00a0sphere of influence until 1989. See similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning this Poland -\u00a0Signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact thwarted the UK\u2019s expansionist plans in Europe,\u00a0The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact did not violate the rights of the Polish state,\u00a0The shift of all blame for WWII outbreak at the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact the best example of manipulation of history.",

The \"investigative US media\" invoked by Sputnik is just one article from February 2020, whose author falsely claims that the ledger \"suddenly appeared in Kyiv during the 2016 US election.\" The article, which is mostly based on older opinion columns by the same author. The \"black ledger\" is a handwritten record of illicit payments, totalling over $66 million, which Ukraine's then-President Viktor Yanukovych made to a number of his political associates between 2007 and 2012. These documents were uncovered already in 2014 and partially published by a prominent Ukrainian news website in May 2016, whereas the full version was published (not \"leaked\") by Ukraine's National Anticorruption Bureau (NABU) in August that year. Shortly thereafter the documents were examined by The New York Times reporters, who received confirmation of their authenticity from \"others in Ukraine who were also named in the ledger.\" There is no evidence suggesting that the ledger is a fabrication, much less that it was \"created from scratch\" by Ukrainian officials to aid the Obama administration in bringing down candidate Trump. Although NABU pointed out that the mere presence of Paul Manafort's name in the ledger does not prove he received any payments from Yanukovych's entourage, two of these payments were later corroborated by the Associated Press. The same news report notes the payments \"are unrelated to the 2016 presidential campaign,\" meaning that the ledger could not have been admitted as evidence in any US proceedings concerning Russian interference in the election.",

            "description": "US officials and pro-Democratic media have spent well over three years accusing President Trump of being a Kremlin agent, and claiming that Moscow was engaged in an aggressive pro-Trump interference campaign in 2016. These allegations, collectively known as \u2018Russiagate,\u2019 essentially collapsed in April 2019, after the release of a 400+ page report by special counsel Robert Mueller. Mueller, who spent over two years examining alleged coordination between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign in 2016, found no evidence of collusion. Furthermore, Mueller\u2019s charges regarding instances of actual alleged \u2018Russian meddling\u2019 were limited to Facebook and Twitter trolling campaigns whose effectiveness and significance have repeatedly been called into question.",

Before the Mueller report was published, Russian meddling in the 2016 election had already been\u00a0established by US intelligence agencies. Thus, the Special Investigation was\u00a0primarily concerned\u00a0with \"whether any Americans [\u2026] joined the Russian conspiracies to influence the election\" (p.2). Robert Mueller makes clear in his\u00a0report\u00a0that \"collusion\" is not a legal concept under US federal law, and that gathering evidence thereof would have fallen outside the scope of the special counsel investigation (p. 2). The report does, in fact, identify \"numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign\" (p. 9). Given its focus on the criminal component of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential poll, Mueller's team did not aim to assess the impact of these campaigns on US voter behaviour. The investigation ascertained that \"Russia's two principal interference operations [\u2026] violated US criminal law\" (p. 9) and were carried out in \"sweeping and systematic fashion\" (p. 1), noting that 13 Russian nationals implicated in these operations have been charged with \"conspiracy to defraud the United States\" (p. 174).

Similar cases include: The US has recognised Euromaidan as a coup controlled by US officials and The West organised the Maidan coup to make Ukraine an anti-Russian state. In fact, the demonstrations that began in Kyiv in November 2013,\u00a0called the \"Maidan\" or \"Euromaidan\", emerged organically as a result of the Ukrainian people's frustration with former President Yanukovych's last-minute U-turn on the highly anticipated EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, which had been under negotiation for seven years. See the full debunk of this disinformation claim\u00a0here. On February 18-20 Ukraine commemorated the 6th anniversary of the Maidan\u2019s bloodiest three days. On February 20 alone, 48 people were killed and 80 wounded on Instytutska street by snipers. In those three days, 78 protesters and 13 policemen lost their lives. Ukraine is a sovereign and independent state with a democratically-elected president and parliament. Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected by almost the whole world. The\u00a0EU\u00a0and the\u00a0US\u00a0work closely with Ukraine. Their relations are not oriented against Russia.",

Back then, the Ukrainian government explained they were taking this decision because of economic problems and their need to improve relations with Russia. Russia had repeatedly warned Ukraine against signing the agreement on the eve of the Vilnius Summit, promising a sharp deterioration of economic ties between the countries. The European Union regretted the decision and said that the door to the association remains open. In Ukraine, the same decision triggered a series of protests known as Euromaidan\".

From the point of view of the Chinese intelligence, the current toxic cocktail can\u2019t be simply attributed to a series of coincidences. Beijing has reasons to believe that this extraordinary chain of events is a part of coordinated Hybrid War against China. Enter the Dragon Killer working hypothesis: a biological weapon attack able to cause immense economic damage but protected by plausible deniability, the only possible move of the US in the New Great Game, considering that it can win neither a conventional nor a nuclear war against China. On the surface, the coronavirus seems to be a biological weapon of dreams for those obsessed with harming China and causing a regime change.",

The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) - which is comprised of the Dutch Public Prosecution Service officials and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy. At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was taken back to the Russian Federation. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17 originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, the Dutch Public Persecution service will persecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of MH17 and murdering the 298 persons on board. The public hearing is scheduled for 9 March 2020 in the Netherlands. The European Union and NATO have\u00a0called on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability. On the basis of the JIT\u2019s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the BUK installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are formally\u00a0holding Russia accountable. See similar cases such as The MH17 disaster was carefully planned by Ukraine and Western intelligence agencies and JIT chose to ignore Russian evidence of the MH17 crash.",

In Romania many of the NGOs have advocated to remove religion from the school curriculum and introduce sex education to children, with the goal to destroy the innocence of the little ones and to strip their religious values. From the early age they would be transformed into the new man of Soros, who does not know what he is and who believes that everything is possible and allowed. After the destruction of national and cultural identity, the destruction of sexual identity is the last blow Soros wants to apply to humanity. As for the purpose of sexualising children and lowering the legal age for sexual acts, this step is meant to pave the way for the legalisation of paedophilia, an older aspiration of the world\u2019s billionaires.",

The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was an organic reaction by numerous sectors of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych\u2019s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013.See the full debunk of this disinformation claim here. The protesters' demands included constitutional reform, a stronger role for parliament, formation of a government of National unity, an end to corruption, early presidential elections and an end to violence. The territories of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts (regions) are internationally recognised parts of Ukraine. The EU has stressed on several occasions that Ukraine\u2019s borders must be respected. On the 27th of March 2014, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 68/262 confirming Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Moreover, the international community, including the European Union, recognises and condemns clear violations of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014.\u00a0 See similar cases claiming that 2014 coup in Kyiv led to the Crimea referendum, the Donbas war and that the Western-backed coup in Ukraine has torn the country asunder.",

Malaysia's Prosecutor's office cooperated in the investigation conducted by the Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT). Speaking at the press conference of the JIT on June 19, 2019, the deputy Prosecutor General of Malaysia, Mohamad Hanafiah bin Zakaria, reiterated Malaysia's commitment to the JIT in seeking justice for the victims and stated that the JIT findings were based on extensive investigation and legal research. [See at 57:30 - 58:14] On the 24th of May 2018, the JIT announced its conclusion that the BUK TELAR used to shoot down MH17 came from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, a unit of the Russian armed forces from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, the Dutch Public Prosecution Service are prosecuting Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of the MH17 and murdering the 289 persons on board. The public hearing started on March 9th 2020 in the Netherlands. The European Union and NATO have called\u00a0on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability. On the basis of the JIT\u2019s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the BUK installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are\u00a0formally\u00a0holding Russia accountable. Read our past analysis Renewed Focus on MH17 about pro-Kremlin disinformation tactics to hide the facts behind MH17 downing, and Disinformation Mash-Up: MH17 and Coronavirus about the synchronised messaging on two entirely unrelated topics: MH17 and the coronavirus outbreak. Read other disinformation narratives alleging that Malaysia was sidelined from the MH17 investigation, that the Netherlands is going to sabotage the MH17 trial,\u00a0that Ukrainian regiment that shot down MH17, and that biased JIT ignores massive data supplied by Russia.",

Adelbert Holl in his memoir describes the daily life in the camps: \"the crowding, the dirt, the cold, the ever-present threat of disease, the forced marches, the indifference or cruelty of the guards. The Soviets treated German prisoners as slave labourers, working them exhaustively, in often appalling conditions. The prisoners could only struggle to survive, to support each other, and hope against hope to return home\". The working and living conditions were harsh and according to Soviet records, 381067 German Wehrmacht POWs died in NKVD camps (356,700 German nationals and 24,367 from other nations), while German historian R\u00fcdiger Overmans also believes, in his book (Soldaten hinter Stacheldraht. Deutsche Kriegsgefangene des Zweiten Weltkriege. Ullstein. Page 246 ) that there were men who actually died as POWs amongst those listed as missing-in-action (MIA).",

The resolution is aimed at the promotion of historical remembrance about WWII and condemnation of totalitarian ideologies.

On September 12th 2001, one day after the 9/11 attacks, all NATO countries voted unanimously to invoke Article 5, as had been previously requested by US National Security Advisor, Condoleezza Rice. Troops from 51 NATO and partner nations took part in the subsequent operation of the Atlantic Alliance in Afghanistan, assuming the leadership of the UN-mandated International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in August 2003. Over 1,000 soldiers from America\u2019s NATO allies have since died in the Afghanistan War. This is part of a recurrent pro-Kremlin narrative aiming to portray NATO as a dysfunctional and useless institution which has lost its purpose after the USSR's dissolution. You can see other examples of disinformation on NATO in our database, such as its obsolescence, cannibalistic character, fascistic tendencies and links to white supremacist ideology, its never-ending provocations, its attempts to block Moscow in its sphere of influence, the Alliance's permanent targeting of Russia and Belarus, its role as a US subjugation tool for other countries and its unreliability to defend its members, its plans to continue attacking other countries, or the claims that NATO's anti-Russian stance is\u00a0the only unifying force among its members and that it caused massive casualties\u00a0during its bombing campaign against Serbia.",

New media reports on the circumstances of the crash of the Malaysian Boeing in the skies over the Donbas in July 2014 cast doubt on the position of an international investigation team that accused Russia of involvement in the tragedy. This once again shows that there is still a huge number of issues that seriously question such a biased position, which has already been voiced many times.",

According to the Russian investigative journalism site The Insider, the documents list the coordinates of the points where the Ukrainian and Russian Buk-M1 systems known to intelligence were located and conclude that none of them could have brought down the Malaysian airliner. However, it is not an exhaustive list of BUK missiles that could have been located in the area of the disaster. See further reporting by the Insider.\u00a0 The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) - which is comprised of the the Dutch Public Prosecution Service officials and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy (or: Pervomaiskyi). At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was taken\u00a0back to the Russian Federation.\u00a0The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT), has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17, originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT the Dutch Public Persecution service will persecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of the MH17 and murdering the 298 persons on board. The public hearing is scheduled for 9 March 2020 in the Netherlands. The European Union and NATO have\u00a0called\u00a0on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability.\u00a0On the basis of the JIT\u2019s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the Buk installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are\u00a0formally holding Russia accountable. For further cases on MH17, see here.",

Contrary to the claims, the multi-national Joint Investigation Team conducted an intensive investigation, with a mountain of evidence which will be presented at the forthcoming trial. The JIT\u00a0announced that it will issue international arrest warrants for three Russian military and intelligence officers \u2013 Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinskiy, Oleg Pulatov \u2013 and Ukrainian national Leonid Kharchenko, commander of the military combat unit in Donetsk. They will be prosecuted for their involvement in the murder of the 298 passengers aboard MH17, which was brought down by a Russian Buk missile. The Dutch-led criminal investigation by the\u00a0Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has been ongoing since 2014. On 28 September 2016, the JIT announced that flight MH17 was shot down by a missile from the 9M38 series, which was launched by a BUK TELAR missile system. The system was transported from the Russian Federation to an agricultural field near the town of Pervomaiskyi in Eastern Ukraine, from where the missile was launched. After firing, the system - with one missing missile - went back to the Russian Federation. On the 24 May 2018, the JIT announced its conclusion that the BUK TELAR used to shoot down MH17 came from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, a unit of the Russian armed forces from Kursk in the Russian Federation. In 2018, Bellingcat also established that two people who, with great certainty, were involved in the MH17 disaster are the two Russian army high-ranking officers: GRU officer Oleh Ivannikov\u00a0and General-Colonel\u00a0Nikolai Tkachev. See similar cases: \"The task of the JIT is not to conduct an objective investigation, but to blame Russia for the tragedy\", \"MH17 investigation is biased\", \"There is still no evidence\u00a0of\u00a0Russian involvement in the MH17 disaster\".",

            "content": "This case adds a new spin to the Kremlin's disinformation campaign to discredit the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) inquiry into the downing of the flight MH17. The allegedly leaked documents do not contradict the findings of the\u00a0Joint Investigation Team (JIT). According to the Russian investigative journalism site the Insider, the documents list the coordinates of the points where the Ukrainian and Russian Buk-M1 systems known to intelligence were located and conclude that none of them could have brought down the Malaysian airliner. However it is not an exhaustive list of BUK missiles that could have been located in the area of the disaster. See further reporting by the Insider.\u00a0 The Joint Investigation Team (JIT), comprised of the the Dutch Public Prosecution Service officials and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine, has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy (or: Pervomaiskyi). At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was taken\u00a0back to the Russian Federation.\u00a0The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT), has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17, originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation.

            "content": "This case adds a new spin to the Kremlin's disinformation campaign to discredit the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) inquiry into the downing of the flight MH17. The disinformation message refers to newly-released documents from 2016, possibly pertaining to the JIT investigation, that allegedly contradict its findings. According to Russian investigative journalism site the Insider, the documents in question list the coordinates of the points where the Ukrainian and Russian Buk-M1 systems known to intelligence had been located and conclude that none of them could have brought down the Malaysian airliner. However it is not an exhaustive list of BUK missiles that could have been located in the area of the disaster. See further reporting by the Insider.\u00a0 Joint Investigation Team (JIT), comprised of the the Dutch Public Prosecution Service officials and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine, has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy (or: Pervomaiskyi). At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was taken\u00a0back to the Russian Federation.\u00a0The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT), has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17, originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT the Dutch Public Persecution service will persecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of the MH17 and murdering the 298 persons on board. The first session of the court proceedings is scheduled for March 9 2020 in the Netherlands. The European Union and NATO have\u00a0called\u00a0on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability.\u00a0On the basis of the JIT\u2019s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the Buk installation that was used to down MH17.

            "content": "This case adds a new spin to the Kremlin's disinformation campaign to discredit the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) inquiry into the downing of the flight MH17. The allegedly leaked documents do not contradict the findings of the\u00a0Joint Investigation Team (JIT). According to the Russian investigative journalism site the Insider, the documents list the coordinates of the points where the Ukrainian and Russian Buk-M1 systems known to intelligence were located and conclude that none of them could have brought down the Malaysian airliner. However it is not an exhaustive list of BUK missiles that could have been located in the area of the disaster. See further reporting by the Insider.\u00a0 The Joint Investigation Team (JIT), comprised of the the Dutch Public Prosecution Service officials and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine, has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy (or: Pervomaiskyi). At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was taken\u00a0back to the Russian Federation.\u00a0The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT), has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17, originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT the Dutch Public Persecution service will persecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of the MH17 and murdering the 298 persons on board. The first session of the court proceedings is scheduled for March 9 2020 in the Netherlands. The European Union and NATO have\u00a0called\u00a0on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability.\u00a0On the basis of the JIT\u2019s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the Buk installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are\u00a0formally holding Russia accountable.",

It should be noted that the restrictions include exemptions for humanitarian needs and purposes. In February 2020, the European Council added eight prominent businessmen and two entities linked to those businessmen to the list of persons and entities subject to the sanctions against the Syrian regime and its supporters. The justification was that their activities directly benefited the Assad regime, including through projects located on lands expropriated from persons displaced by the conflict. The sanctions on Syria were originally imposed in 2011. They are reviewed on an annual basis, with the next review due by 1st June.",

This is confirmed by the fact that US State Secretary Mike Pompeo did not visit Lithuania during his recent trip to Eastern Europe, including Belarus. The Lithuanian MFA addressed Latvian and Estonian counterparts to ban imports of Belarusian electricity out of jealousy. On the other hand, it was Washington who instructed Lithuania to declare the Belarusian NPP a threat to its national security. One of the preconditions of lifting US sanctions on Belarus is likely to be the dismantling of the Astravets NPP. In turn, the Belarusian opposition delivered the tasks set by the Baltic states to oppose construction of the NPP.",

It is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about the West's activities to harm Belarus. Lithuania opposes the construction of the Astravets Nuclear power Plant (NPP) as the project does not comply with the international standards of environmental protection and nuclear safety, and is built on the site that was not duly justified over alternatives, according to Lithuania. On 7 June 2011,\u00a0Lithuania lodged a complaint with the Implementing Committee of the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment\u00a0(the Espoo Convention) on the Astravets nuclear power plant case. The February 2019 draft decision of the Meeting of the Parties of the Espoo Convention\u00a0acknowledged that Belarus had failed to comply with some Convention provisions and encouraged Belarus and Lithuania to continue bilateral expert consultations. On 20 April 2017, the Lithuanian parliament passed a bill imposing a ban on import of electricity from Belarus' nuclear power plant in Astravets. It was reported in early February 2020 that the governments of the three Baltic nations will sign a declaration of intent to oppose electricity purchases from the Astravets NPP. See earlier disinformation cases concerning the Belarusian NPP, including claims that\u00a0Lithuania fights against Belarusian NPP on the orders of Sweden and Finland, Dalia Grybauskait\u0117's opposition to the NPP is an attempt to hide Lithuania's own failures in nuclear power,\u00a0that the \"Chernobyl\" series aimed to discredit the Belarusian power plant and Belarus-Russia relations and that Western-financed environmental NGOs in Belarus stage a big campaign against Rosatom and Russia.",

Coronavirus is the best tool for the opposition to weaken the state authorities, to prevent presidential elections, and to organise a coup. To provoke public discontent, opposition members need millions of infected people and they would not hesitate to do it. Together with the Belarusian [Orthodox] Autocephalous Church, they hold prayer services glorifying God for sending coronavirus to end the Belarusian dictatorship. Coronavirus also allows them to criticise Russians for closing the borders with China and checking Belarusian citizens upon arrival to Russia.",

At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was taken back to the Russian Federation. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) \u00a0has concluded that the BUK-TELAR, used to shoot down MH17, originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. International investigators announced charges against four suspects accused of shooting down flight MH17 on the 19th of June 2019. Read here a similar case claiming that\u00a0 MH17 was shot down from territory under the control of the Ukrainian army and that the MH17 Joint Investigation Team is ignoring information presented by the Buk manufacturer.",

While aware of pro-Kremlin disinformation campaigns, the West is trying to keep open channels of communications and cooperation with Russia. For instance, NATO as the Western organisation created cooperation bodies \u2013 the Permanent Joint Council and the NATO-Russia Council \u2013 to embody its relationship with Russia. It also invited Russia to cooperate on missile defence. The Warsaw Summit Communique 2016 describes NATO's official policy towards Russia: \"The Alliance does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia. But we cannot, and will not, compromise on the principles on which our Alliance and security in Europe and North America rest.\" The EU and its member states have maintained a clear policy of reaching out to Russian society and youth, mainly through the Erasmus+ student exchange programme and other people to people contacts, in line with five guiding principles of relations with Russia. Read similar disinformation cases alleging that NATO cultivates Cold War block thinking and considers Russia as an enemy and that NATO and EU are actively fabricating Russophobia in the Baltic States to justify their anti-Russian policies.

A special team, known as the\u00a0Joint Investigation Team (JIT), was established to conduct the criminal investigation\u00a0of the downing of the Malaysian Airlines flight MH17. The JIT comprises officials from the Dutch Public Prosecution Service and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. The JIT has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy. At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was\u00a0taken\u00a0back to the Russian Federation.\u00a0The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT), has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17, originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. The prosecution of 4 suspects begins on 9th of March 2020, as decided by the Dutch Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (PPO), which has the unanimous support of the investigation authorities of the other countries in the Joint Investigation Team (JIT): Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. The PPO will present the case to an independent court in a public hearing under the Dutch legal system.

The article in the Times is based on an assessment of the Irish security services of an operation that took place in 2019, in which Russia intended to use technology to monitor data exchanges on the underseas cables to give Moscow an insight into internet communications. The agents in question were also monitored mapping Dublin Port, resulting in security increases at a number of landing sites around the Irish coastline. The Irish Defence Forces and Garda Headquarters, the national police service, suspect the GRU of using Ireland as an operations base for its officers to gather intelligence on targets in Britain and in the EU, and that it is also spying on tech companies based in Dublin. For similar cases seeking to discredit evidence of GRU activities and operations, including in the Skripal case, see here.",

            "content": "An unfounded, recurrent, narrative that Naftogaz of Ukraine blackmails Russia.\u00a0 The claim of the Ukrainian company Naftogaz against Russia because of lost assets in the Crimea in mentioned, but nothing is against Gazprom. The trial has been going on for several years, and the Permanent Court of Arbitration is in charge of the case. Naftogaz demands compensation of $5 billion from Russia for the loss of assets as a result of the occupation of Crimea. Including interest, this amount has grown to $8 billion. In 2019, the Court found in favour of Naftogaz, concluding that Russia is liable for the unlawful seizure of Naftogaz assets in Crimea under the bilateral investment treaty between Ukraine and Russia. At the moment, the second stage of the arbitration proceedings has begun which will determine the amount of compensation for Naftogaz's losses. Naftogaz claims that the agreement reached in December 2019 with Gazprom deals exclusively with gas transit issues, while the lawsuit that the Arbitration Court in The Hague is considering involves a completely different area. The difference is that Ukraine already nullified its claims directly against Gazprom for disrupting contracts for gas supplies to the EU, but did not agree to terminate trials against Russia because of lost assets in occupied Crimea. \u201cWhy are we suing if, before the New Year, we entered into a settlement? We concluded an agreement with Gazprom, and the Russian Federation is the second side of this process\u201d Naftogaz reported. Background: The agreement between Naftogaz and Gazprom was reached at the end of December 2019. Gazprom paid Naftogaz about $ 3 billion in compensation for neglecting the terms of the previous contract for gas transit through the Ukrainian gas transport system to the European Union. It is on this key issue that Naftogaz previously won a trial against Gazprom.",

            "description": "One of the main obstacles to the Minsk agreements is \u201cKyiv\u2019s unwillingness to engage in normal dialogue with Donetsk and Luhansk. This obligation is obviously not being met, although this is one of the main conditions of the Minsk package\u201d. (\u2026) From Kyiv, in statements by deputies close to the President, it was repeatedly heard that the army should be ready to use force, if necessary, to reclaim the Donbas areas. In other words, the military aspect is also visible, although the Normandy format was originally planned as an opportunity to solve the problems in south-eastern Ukraine in a peaceful way. Kyiv\u2019s aim is to reorientate, to rebuild the whole system of the Minsk agreement. Following the visit of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Kyiv, the rhetoric on the Ukrainian side has changed dramatically, which has led to a worsening of the situation in the Donbas. Ukraine is a controlled country, and for the United States, the worsening of relations between Ukraine and Russia is now more important than the peaceful settlement in Ukraine. (\u2026) Ukraine is not a fully sovereign state. Therefore, it must be understood that the current situation is not being led by Ukraine itself, not by its people, but by the forces in Europe and the US, which are behind the current Ukrainian leadership and are using Ukraine for their own purposes.",

Since 2014, negotiations with Russia to resolve the conflict in the Donbas have been held within the framework of the Normandy Format and the Minsk process. A special\u00a0Trilateral\u00a0contact group is working on a peaceful settlement of the situation in Donbas. Three parties are involved in this process: representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE. Unofficially, representatives of the so-called \"LDNR\" factions are also present. Ukraine is not the only party to the conflict in the Donbas. In 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted Russia's military presence in Ukraine. The second set of measures to implement the Minsk agreements was signed on\u00a012 February 2015. But there are no conditions that the Ukrainian authorities should conduct direct negotiations with the leaders of the self-proclaimed \"republics DNR/LNR\" in the Minsk agreements that are supported by Russia. Moreover, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted a resolution on the progress of the Assembly's monitoring procedure which stated concerns over Russia on condition of human rights and rule of law, 'borderisation' and creeping annexation of Georgian regions, implementation of the Minsk agreements and cooperation over the downing of the MH17 flight. Ukraine is a sovereign, independent state. Relations between the EU, US and Ukraine are bilateral relations between independent countries. They are established on an equal basis. Read similar cases alleging that Kyiv does not want to implement the current Minsk agreements and that Ukraine is an anti-Russian state under Western control.",

In the\u00a0statement\u00a0of 21 December 2019, Polish authorities reiterated their openness to continue the historical dialogue with Russia, for example through the restart of the work of the bilateral Group on Difficult Issues. However, they stated, the recent words of President Putin regarding Polish history have ruined the outcomes of cooperation of the Polish and Russian historians, who tried to look for ways of reconciling Polish-Russian relations.

            "description": "The US would need a person completely dependent on CIA as the head of Belarus. He would need to have double citizenship, an English accent and thesis about the methods of US colonial governance in Eastern Europe defended at the Yale University. The current foreign minister Uladzimir Makey, although pro-Western, will only satisfy the West as a transitional figure. After the US Department of Commerce recognises Belarus as a market economy, it will soon join the WTO and sign a free trade agreement with the EU. The opening of Belarusian markets will be accompanied by filling legislative and executive branches of power with radical pro-Western and Russophobic forces. They would provide a political cover for the revolution. After political and judicial systems are placed under West\u2019s control, the public sector will become insolvent and the most important dozen of enterprises will be privatised by American transnational companies. The agricultural sector will be shut down, the IT sector will die, just as other economy branches including machine building. Massive unemployment and economic collapse will provoke mass emigration, while social protests will be oppressed by radicals which are currently trained in Polish and Baltic training camps. IMF-designed shock therapy would mean a colour revolution implemented through soft power. It will result in complete Belarus\u2019 colonization by the West, foremost by the US but with the participation of Poland, Germany and Austria. Just as Ukraine, Belarus will come under external control and a puppet regime will be established. All economic policies, including negative ones, will pursue the aim to displace any Russian influence in Belarus.",

            "content": "This is a recurring effort by pro-Kremlin disinformation outlets to represent grassroots protest movements in post-Soviet countries, including Russia itself, Ukraine, and others, as plotted by US to destabilise those countries and weaken Russia. Thus, the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine in 2014 are presented as a coup fomented alternatively by the West, Georges Soros, or Victoria Nuland from the US in person; it is also often\u00a0 portrayed as a \"Nazi coup\". In fact, the demonstrations that began in Kyiv in November 2013, called \"Maidan\" or \"Euromaidan\", emerged organically as a result of the Ukrainian people's frustration with former President Yanukovych's last-minute\u00a0 U-turn on the highly anticipated EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, which had been under negotiation for seven years. For more cases about the Euromaidan protests, see\u00a0here. The conspiracy theory about Georgian snipers shooting at Maidan protesters on 20 February 2014 has been previously debunked and is not supported by evidence. Pro-Kremlin disinformation has spread different versions of the identity of the snipers. For further debunking about recurring disinformation on the Georgian snipers, see StopFake,\u00a0Myth Detector,\u00a0The Insider\u00a0and\u00a0Polygraph. Finally, the movie \"The Ukraine Hoax: Impeachment, Biden Cash, Mass Murder\" is a documentary produced by Michael Caputo, a Republican strategist, and has not been endorsed by any US authorities. It therefore in no way entails that \"the US recognise(s) Euromaidan as a coup for the first time\". Read more about the film on StopFake.",

The original Ukrainian Community of Crimea existed long before the annexation of the peninsula and now it continues to exist on the \"mainland\" Ukraine. After the annexation of Crimea, there were two attempts to \"recreate\" this organisation. The second time in 2018, it was founded under the leadership of\u00a0 a member of the \"Young Guard of United Russia\". The other founders include a member of the Simferopol branch of \"United Russia\" party and a deputy chairman of the Belarusian organisation. \"They [the new Ukrainian Community of Crimea] participate in the many official events of the current Crimean authorities, in the reception of foreign delegations. All this time they glorify Putin and say how the Crimean authorities are looking out for the rights and development of Ukrainians in Crimea,\" a journalist from Crimea Anna Andrievska told RFE/RL. No international body recognises the illegal referendum, announced on the 27th of February 2014, and held on 16th of March 2014. The EU's\u00a0policy of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol includes a set of restrictive measures against entities and individuals responsible for actions against Ukraine's territorial integrity.\u00a0In March 2019, on the fifth anniversary of Crimea's annexation,\u00a0the EU reiterated its position of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol. The EU continues to stand in full solidarity with Ukraine, supporting its sovereignty and territorial integrity. See similar cases: Crimea regained its Russian identity at the will of its people\u00a0and the US recognised Crimea as Russian.",

            "content": "This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative regarding the downing of flight MH17, aimed at obscuring Russia's responsibility for the tragedy. A Joint Investigation Team (JIT) was established to conduct the criminal investigation of the downing of the Malaysian Airlines flight MH17. The JIT comprises officials from the Dutch Public Prosecution Service and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. The JIT has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy.\u00a0 At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation\u00a0and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was taken back to the Russian Federation. On 24 May 2018, JIT stated\u00a0that the BUK-TELAR that was used to down MH17 originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. The JIT reached this conclusion after extensive comparative research. An animation of this comparative research is\u00a0available here. The Joint Investigation Team issued international arrest warrants in June 2019 for four individuals identified as being complicit in the shooting down of MH17: three Russian military and intelligence officers Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinskiy, Oleg Pulatov and Ukrainian national Leonid Kharchenko, commander of the military combat unit in Donetsk. Their  trial will begin On 9 March 2020. They will be prosecuted for their involvement in the murder of the 298 passengers aboard MH17, which was brought down by a Russian Buk missile.

The transfer of Crimea and Sevastopol to Ukraine was first officially agreed on 25 January 1954 at a meeting of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee. The members of the Presidium, voting for the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine, took into account objective reasons: \u201cthe commonality of the economy, territorial proximity and close economic and cultural ties between the Crimean region and the Ukrainian SSR.\u201d On 19 February 1954, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR confirmed the need for Crimea to join Soviet Ukraine. Legally, the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine ended on 26 April 1954, on the basis of the relevant law of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. According to international law, Crimea is a part of Ukraine. After the collapse of the USSR, Russia reaffirmed respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. By signing the 1997 Friendship Treaty, Russia also recognised that Crimea is an integral part of Ukraine. No international body recognises the so-called referendum, announced on the 27th of February 2014, and held on 16th of March 2014. A year after the illegal annexation, Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted that the plan to annex Crimea was ordered weeks before the so-called referendum. The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has stated that \u201cthe situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. This International armed conflict began at the latest on 26 February 2014 when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of \u00a0Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government\". On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution\u00a0in which it stated that the referendum in Crimea was\u00a0not valid\u00a0and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly\u00a0confirmed\u00a0its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea. The EU's\u00a0policy of non-recognition\u00a0of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol includes a set of restrictive measures against entities and individuals responsible for actions against Ukraine's territorial integrity.\u00a0In March 2019, on the fifth anniversary of Crimea'sannexation,\u00a0the EU reiterated its position of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol.The \u00a0EU continues to stand in full solidarity with Ukraine, supporting its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Read similar cases claiming that Crimean people have expressed their desire to rejoin Russia in a democratic process and that Crimea never belonged to Ukraine.",

            "content": "One of the many recurring, and occasionally conflicting, disinformation narratives around the downing of flight MH17 which appear again due to the imminent trial of the suspects (see below). Russia's interest in aiding the JIT investigation is not a relevant condition of its membership. The crash did not take place over Russian territory and claimed no Russian lives, which precludes any basis for Moscow to be represented in the JIT. Dutch Chief Prosecutor Fred Westerbeke\u00a0told a Russian newspaper\u00a0that \"if MH17 were shot down over Russia, I would have suggested that Russia be made a member of the JIT group.\" The \"evidence\" claimed by Russia, namely radar data and the \"field experiment\" conducted by the Russian military company Almaz-Antey, is only a small sample of\u00a0misleading claims\u00a0advanced by Moscow since 2015, some of which have\u00a0contradicted one another. Also, Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta found the claim that the Buk\u00a0was of \"Ukrainian origin\"\u00a0to be\u00a0fabricated. The Dutch-led criminal investigation by the\u00a0Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has been ongoing since 2014. On 28 September 2016, the JIT announced that flight MH17 was shot down by a missile from the 9M38 series, which was launched by a BUK TELAR missile system. The system was transported from the Russian Federation to an agricultural field near the town of Pervomaiskyi in Eastern Ukraine, from where the missile was launched. After firing, the system - with 1 missing missile - went back to the Russian Federation. On the 24 May 2018, the JIT announced its conclusion that the BUK TELAR used to shoot down MH17 came from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, a unit of the Russian armed forces from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, the Dutch Public Persecution service will persecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the crash of MH17 and murdering the 298 persons on board. The public hearing started on 9 March 2020 in the Netherlands. See further disinformation claims alleging that The MH17 disaster was carefully planned by Ukraine and Western intelligence agencies, US and UK falsely blamed Russia for downing MH17, Ukraine is hiding evidence in the tragedy of flight MH17 to this day.",

            "content": "This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative attempting to undermine the credibility of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) that is investigating the MH17 disaster. Firstly, Russia's stated interest to be involved in the JIT investigation is not a sufficient condition for its membership in the team. The crash did not take place over Russian territory and claimed no Russian lives, which precludes any basis for Moscow to be represented in the JIT. Dutch Chief Prosecutor Fred Westerbeke\u00a0told\u00a0a Russian newspaper that \"if MH17 were shot down over Russia, I would have suggested that Russia be made a member of the JIT group.\" In earlier attacks on the JIT's integrity, pro-Kremlin outlets have accused the investigation team of bias, bribery, extortion, Russophobia, evidence-tampering, ignoring \"information\" kindly furnished by Moscow, and being in thrall to Western security services. Background: The criminal investigation in the case was led by the JIT since 2014. On 28 September 2016, the JIT announced that flight MH17 was shot down by a missile from the 9M38 series, which was launched by a BUK TELAR missile system. The system was transported from the Russian Federation to an agricultural field near the town of Pervomaiskyi in Eastern Ukraine, from where the missile was launched. After firing, the system - with 1 missing missile - went back to the Russian Federation. On the 24th of May 2018, the JIT announced\u00a0its conclusion the BUK TELAR used to shoot down MH17 came from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, a unit of the Russian armed forces from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, with the participation of law enforcement agencies from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, Ukraine and the Netherlands, the Dutch Public Prosecution Service will prosecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the MH17 crash and murdering all 298 persons on board. The Public Prosecution Service alleges that the four individuals cooperated to obtain and deploy the BUK TELAR at the firing location with the aim of shooting down an aircraft. For that reason, they can also be held jointly accountable for downing flight MH17. The JIT conclusions were further corroborated by\u00a0the Bellingcat Investigation Team.",

It is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the West's alleged moral decline and rejection of traditional family values in favour of LGBTQ rights. In the US, as of December 2010, the word \"parent\" (without numbers one or two) replaced \"father\" and \"mother\" in passport applications and consular records of births abroad. This designation therefore applies to people born outside the US and pertains only to this specific domain - it is not standardised terminology. Meanwhile, in France, a bill was indeed proposed to introduce the use of \"Parent 1\" and \"Parent 2\" in school paperwork. However, after passing the first reading of the National Assembly, it was abandoned. Documentation for French schools may now contain only references to \"mother\", \"father\" and \"another legal representative\". For more disinformation cases on LGBTQ \"propaganda\" in the West, see here.",

A special team, known as the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), was established to conduct the\u00a0criminal investigation. The JIT comprises officials from the Dutch Public Prosecution Service and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. The Netherlands is leading an international investigation into MH17 being shot down on 17 July 2014, killing all 298 people on board. About two-thirds of the victims were Dutch nationals. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, with the participation of law enforcement agencies, the Dutch Public Prosecution Service will prosecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the MH17 crash and murdering all 298 persons on board. The Netherlands rejected an offer by Moscow to prosecute three Russian men (Igor Girkin, Oleg Pulatov, and Sergei Dubinsky) suspected of involvement in the 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. Pro-Kremlin media accused the Netherlands of violating the UN Security Council resolution. But the resolution merely states it supports efforts to establish a full, thorough and independent international investigation into the incident in accordance with international civil aviation guidelines.",

The war in eastern Ukraine is not a civil conflict, but a well-documented act of aggression by Russian armed forces, ongoing since February 2014. In 2015, during an inspection of the storage sites of heavy weapons of \u201cDNR\u201d militants, OSCE SMM observers saw the Russian military guarding one of the sites. At the same time, the OSCE noted that the Russian military did not have any insignia. In 2016, the deputy chairman of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, Alexander Hug, confirmed to Ukrainian journalists that the OSCE SMM has information that there are Russian troops in eastern Ukraine. In addition, the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine systematically records cases of the transfer of both military and weapons from Russia to the occupied territory of Donbas. OSCE has repeatedly emphasised that Russian-separatist forces in eastern Ukraine often use temporarily declared ceasefire in order to receive supplies with arms and ammunition from Russia under the guise of humanitarian aid.",

This disinformation case spread in the context of a\u00a0visit by US Secretary\u00a0of State Mike Pompeo to Ukraine. In addition to official meetings, he held informal meetings with Ukrainian activists. During a meeting with Crimean representatives, the former deputy head of the Ministry of Information Policy of Ukraine, the representative of the Crimean Tatar people Emine Dzheppar, asked the White House to keep annexed Crimea insight of US foreign policy and\u00a0categorically denies\u00a0that Pompeo said anything about the impossibility of returning Crimea to Ukraine. The\u00a0US Embassy\u00a0in Ukraine also denied that Pompeo mentioned anything about Crimea being a lost cause. Moreover, at a press briefing with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Pompeo\u00a0emphasised\u00a0that the United States of America will never recognise the annexation of Crimea by Russia. Pompeo also recalled that the United States fully supports the\u00a0Crimea Declaration of 2018 on the non-recognition of the Russian annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. Regarding the accusations that Robert O\u2019Brien also made similar statements, there is no evidence to back-up these claims. Read similar cases that\u00a0Crimea never belonged to Ukraine\u00a0and that\u00a0Crimea is now recognised as an integral part of Russia. Further debunking by Mythdetector.",

The OPCW is an independent inter-governmental international organisation with 193 member states - including Russia. Pro-Kremlin outlets began portraying the OPCW as a pawn in Western geopolitical designs around mid-2018, when the organisation was being granted new powers to assign blame for chemical attacks, especially in the Syrian Douma. In a joint statement, Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America called for an end to the unacceptable Russian defamation of the OPCW. The OPCW conducts probes into allegations of chemical weapons' use in Syria, and its findings serve as the basis for publicly available reports and expert notes. The document by the Technical Secretariat offers a detailed response\u00a0to\u00a0notes verbales\u00a0in which both Russia and Syria questioned the credibility and legality of the OPCW Fact-Finding Mission in Douma.

            "content": "This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the illegal annexation of\u00a0Crimea. Moscow did not \"return\" the Russian identity to Crimea, but was rather illegally annexed. On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution\u00a0in which it stated that the referendum in Crimea was\u00a0not valid\u00a0and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly\u00a0confirmed\u00a0its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea. According to international law, Crimea is a part of Ukraine. Russia violated international law as well as key principles of the European security framework by\u00a0illegally annexing\u00a0the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol in 2014. Pro-Kremlin outlets began portraying the OPCW as a pawn in Western geopolitical designs around mid-2018, when the organisation was being granted new powers to assign blame for chemical attacks, especially in the Syrian Douma. In a joint statement, Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America called for an end to the unacceptable Russian defamation of the OPCW.",

Crimea is not Russian but was illegally annexed by Moscow based on an illegitimate referendum. On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution\u00a0in which it stated that the referendum in Crimea was\u00a0not valid\u00a0and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly\u00a0confirmed\u00a0its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea. According to international law, Crimea is a part of Ukraine. Russia violated international law as well as key principles of the European security framework by\u00a0illegally annexing the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol in 2014.",

For decades, the Soviet authorities have spread a story about the heroic role of the Red Army in the saving of Krak\u00f3w Old Town from being blown up by retreating Nazi troops. Polish historians have established the narrative of the Nazis, preparing to blow up Krak\u00f3w as a post-war myth aimed at the glorification of the Red Army among the Poles. Famous Soviet television film \"Major Whirlwind\" (1967) came to support this propaganda. See similar case that the Red Army saved Krak\u00f3w from destruction by Nazis, and other examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland such as It is thanks to Russia that Poland today exists as a country,\u00a0Nazi Germany considered Poland its best ally, the USSR was forced and reluctant to sign Molotov-Ribbentrop pact.",

            "description": "It is a well known fact that three bio-laboratories in Armenia, in Yerevan, Gyumri and Idzhevan have been opened with the cooperation with Pentagon. Officially, they are intended to safeguard people and livestock from pandemics. Similar laboratories have been opened in Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. In 2018, the former Georgian minister of national security, Igor Gioradze, disclosed shocking details about one of the laboratories in Georgia, financed by the US ministry of defence: at the facility, experiments on humans were performed, and 73 people had died. The Armenian people have fought for millennia for their independence and for securing the nation; and they will now have to fight again for preserving their statehood. Everyone must understand that in the balance for short- or medium term gains, lies not only the independence, but the existence of the country. This must be a priority when decisions are made about cooperation with foreign partners in such a sensitive field as biological security.",

From the historical point of view, it makes no sense to connect neo-Nazism to the \u201ctimes of the Habsburg Empire\u201d as this state collapsed in 1918, long before the emergence of Nazism and neo-Nazism. The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine has been the cornerstone of Russian disinformation about the country since the very beginning of the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests, when it was used to discredit the pro-European popular uprising in Kyiv and, subsequently, the broader pro-Western shift in Ukraine's foreign policy. Far-right groups enjoyed a\u00a0very limited presence\u00a0during the Euromaidan itself and had poor results in the 2014\u00a0presidential\u00a0and\u00a0parliamentary\u00a0elections. In the 2019 election, far-right candidates\u00a0fell short of the 5% minimum guaranteeing entry into parliament.

            "content": "This message is part of the Kremlin\u2019s policy of\u00a0historical revisionism\u00a0and an attempt to erode the disastrous historical role of the\u00a0Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact\u00a0by making statements that the\u00a0USSR was forced\u00a0to sign this pact; that other European countries\u00a0signed various international agreements with Adolf Hitler,\u00a0that the Munich Agreement triggered WWII\u00a0and various historical conspiracies saying that the Western democracies wanted to inspire a war between Nazism and Communism. Military cooperation with the USSR was the main way that Weimar Germany could overcome the Versailles\u2019 restrictions. The military technologies developed on the territory of the USSR in the 1920s and beginning of the 1930s became the foundation for Hitler\u2019s industrial-military complex in the 1930s. The Soviet-German military cooperation started after the signing of the Treaty of Rapallo in 1922, allowing Germany to overcome the Versailles\u2019 restrictions on the development of the German Army and the industrial-military complex. The facts of the Soviet-German military cooperation throughout the 1920s and beginning of the 1930s are well-documented, despite the attempts of the authorities of the Weimar Republic to hide it. For example, many important German military technologies were developed and tested on the territory of the USSR throughout the 1920s and beginning of the 30s. For example, Junkers constructed air planes near Moscow; Krupp worked on artillery projects near Rostov-on-Don; future Luftwaffe staff trained at the Lipetsk fighter-pilot school and Reichswehr used the Kama tank school for its needs, etc. It is impossible to state that Poland was \u201ca Nazi ally\u201d because it signed the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact\u00a0in 1934. First, unlike the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, it was a standard international agreement aimed at the mutual recognition of borders and a declaration that existing political contradictions would be solved through diplomatic means. There is\u00a0no historical evidence that this pact contained any secret protocols, which assumed common aggressive actions of Germany and Poland against the USSR or other countries. Moreover, the pact did not include any agreements on advanced political, economic and military relations between Poland and Germany. Secondly, in 1934, the plans of Hitler were still unknown, so all European countries carried out normal diplomatic relations with Germany. Before WWII, Poland had tense political relations with Nazi Germany, which expressed open territorial claims on Poland (revision of the status of the\u00a0Free City of Danzig\u00a0and control over the \u201cPolish Corridor\u201d). Despite intense political pressure from Hitler, Poland consistently refused to become part of the Nazi block.

The Giedroyc Doctrine is a political doctrine developed by a well-known Polish publicist Jerzy Giedroy\u0107 in the post-war decades. This Doctrine was aimed at the establishment of good relations of Poland with its neighbours through the rejection of any imperial ambitions and territorial claims against its eastern neighbours, the acceptation of the post-war borders, full support for the independence of Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania. The Doctrine called on both Poland and Russia to abandon their struggle over the domination of other East European countries. In other words, the Giedroyc Doctrine fully rejects any Imperialist ideas. The Eastern policy of Poland after 1989 has been largely based on the Gierdoyc Doctrine \u2013 Poland fully supports the independence and territorial integrity of Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine and stands for the development of a strategic partnership with these countries. The very statement that \u201cBelarus is a natural part of the Russian culture\u201d is a clear manifestation of the Russian Imperialist concept.

The widely recognised date of the outbreak of WWII is September 1st 1939, when the Germans attacked Poland. However, it is possible to provide earlier dates for the outbreak of WWII, for example, the date of the Anschluss of Austria or the date that Czechoslovakia was partitioned.",

The attempts to move the date of the outbreak of WWII to various pre-war events is an example of historical revisionism, carried out in order to shift the co-responsibility of the USSR for the outbreak of WWII on to other European states. Mainstream historiography\u00a0traditionally perceives such historical developments as the Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935), the Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131939), the Japanese invasion of China (1937), the Anschluss (1938) and the Munich Agreements (1938) as pre-war events.

Identifying the events of September 1939 as \"division and occupation\" is a legitimate choice by Polish authorities, considering that this characterisation accurately sums up Soviet conduct toward its eastern neighbour at the time. The interview omits all mention of the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact signed in August 1939 which, in a secret protocol, entitled Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union to their respective \"spheres of influence\" in Eastern Europe. As it were, Poland was divided between the two spheres, its two halves occupied by Germany and the USSR starting 1 September and 17 September 1939, respectively. In laying out its obligation to \"protect\" Ukrainians and Belarusians living in Poland, Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov cited the \"disintegration\" of the Polish state brought about by the German-Polish war. It was unknown at the time (and is unmentioned by Sputnik) that the German invasion of Poland had been agreed upon with the USSR, and thus that the later Soviet campaign to protect the \"kindred Ukrainian and White Russian people\" was also predicated on that very same agreement with Nazi Germany.

            "content": "This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative attempting to paint Russian military aggression against Ukraine as a domestic civil conflict; Moscow's illegal annexation of Crimea as a \"re-unification\" preceded by a legitimate democratic \"referendum\"; and accusations of Russian meddling in Western democratic processes as factually unfounded and driven by \"Russophobia\". No international body has recognised the so-called Crimea referendum, announced on 27 February 2014, and held on 16 March 2014. Thirteen members of the United Nations Security Council\u00a0voted in favour of a resolution declaring the referendum invalid. On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution which stated that the referendum in Crimea was not valid and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly\u00a0confirmed\u00a0its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea. On the fifth anniversary of Crimea's annexation,\u00a0the EU reiterated\u00a0its position of non-recognition of the landgrab and continues to stand in full solidarity with Ukraine, supporting its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Moreover, the international community, including the European Union, recognises and condemns clear violations of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014.\u00a0 Extensive evidence confirms that Russia did meddle in the 2016 US presidential elections, specifically aiming to damage Hillary Clinton's campaign and aid Republican candidate Donald Trump. Some assessments suggest this interference affected the outcome\u00a0of the vote, particularly in three\u00a0critical swing states where Trump's victory margins were the thinnest. Likewise, Russian state efforts to affect the outcome of the Brexit vote are well-documented, both in news reports\u00a0and\u00a0parliamentary enquiries (see especially pp. 43-52).

            "content": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation claiming that sanctions against Russia have no effect and that there is no evidence of election meddling by Russia. In fact, the sanctions from the US and the EU do not aim to punish Russia or the Russian people but were introduced to send a clear signal to the Russian government\u00a0after Russia's illegal annexation of the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula and the downing of the Malaysian passenger plane MH17. Claims that the sanctions are ineffective are not backed by evidence. In reality, most\u00a0research\u00a0supports the view that sanctions, imposed on Russia by the US and EU following the annexation of Crimea and Russian meddling in the US election, have worked as planned, noting the drag they have imposed on Russia\u2019s general economic development since 2014: \"This adverse effect most likely operates by depressing both foreign trade and foreign capital flows into Russia.\u00a0Russia\u2019s own counter-sanctions\u00a0have also had a clear negative effect on the welfare of the average Russian household.\" According to\u00a0the report of the European Parliament, the decline of EU trade with Russia after 2013 can be attributed to a number of factors, most importantly the slump in international oil price which damaged Russian economy and devaluated the ruble. In 2014 Russian GDP growth was as low as 0.7%. It decreased by 2,3% in 2015 and had modest revival afterwards with 0.3%, 1.6%, and 2.3% of growth during 2016-2018, the World Bank data shows. In contrast to Russia,\u00a0during the same period, the EU's economy did not experience recessions and had annual GDP growth between 1.8% and 2.5%. . See StopFake for further debunking of the pro-Kremlin narrative about ineffective Western sanctions. For more cases on the topic, see here. Electoral interference by Russia has been extensively documented in numerous countries around the world. Elections targeted by Moscow include the Brexit vote, in the 2017 French Presidential elections, in the 2017 German Parliamentary elections, in the 2016 constitutional referendum in Italy and in the Dutch referendum on the EU\u2019s Association Agreement with Ukraine, among many others.

            "description": "The belief that the Wuhan coronavirus spread from an animal market was rejected by the World Health Organisation and now many prestigious international scientists launched the idea that virus is a result of bioengineering. Francis Boyle, creator of the 1989 \u2018Law against terrorism and biological weapons\u2019 and specialist at the University of Illinois, claimed that it is a weapon for biological war. His claims were ignored by globalised media involved in an anti-China campaign following the guidelines of the US Department of State. Chinese pathogen QX was taken as base for the coronavirus 2019-nCoV and researched in the Wuhan BSL-4 high security lab, where not only Chinese but also US, British and Canadian biologists had access to it. Interestingly, one of the sponsors of the research was the USAID, an open collaborator of the CIA.",

The Sputnik article presents no source of the quoted number of killed civilians. According to the\u00a0Humanitarian Law Center, in Serbia (excluding Kosovo) and Montenegro,\u00a0275 persons\u00a0lost their lives in the NATO bombings: 180 civilians, 90 members of the Yugoslav Armed Forces and five members of the Ministry of Interior of Serbia. In Kosovo,\u00a0484 people were killed: 267 civilians (209 Albanian and 58 non-Albanian), 171 members of the YA, 20 members of the Serbian MUP and 26 members of the KLA (19 of whom died in the NATO bombing of the Dubrava prison, near Istok). Here\u00a0you can see the list of names of people who lost their lives in NATO bombing. Human Rights Watch\u00a0concludes that as few as 489 and as many as 528 Yugoslav civilians were killed in the ninety separate incidents in Operation Allied Force. Read similar disinformation about the war in former Yugoslavia alleging that\u00a0around 2500 people were killed in NATO\u2019s bombing campaign\u00a0and the returning claim that\u00a0around 2,000 people were killed in NATO\u2019s bombings in [former] Yugoslavia.",

NATO leaders also demanded that Russia complies with international law and its international obligations and responsibilities; end its illegitimate occupation of Crimea; refrain from aggressive actions against Ukraine; halt the flow of weapons, equipment, people and money across the border to the separatists; and stop fomenting tension along and across the Ukrainian border. In 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u00a0admitted Russia's military presence in Ukraine. Read similar narratives about Ukraine's role in the conflict and the Minsk Agreements.",

This narrative claims that almost all European countries are no longer truly sovereign\u00a0and the United States dictates policies to the EU and its member states.\u00a0For pro-Kremlin disinformation, countries that are outside of Russian control are US vassals, and some are vassals of vassals. In fact, the EU Member States are sovereign countries and make sovereign decisions about their own security and policies. The US is an important ally to the EU but EU policy is not determined by the US. Similar disinformation narratives claim that NATO is a new type of US colonialism,\u00a0that European \u00e9lites obey Washington, that EU and NATO member states are subordinate to the US, while the US has long regarded the EU as a kind of protectorate, and that lined up with the US, the EU never took independent decisions. Pro-Kremlin outlets began portraying the OPCW as a pawn in Western geopolitical designs around mid-2018, when the organisation was being granted new powers to assign blame for chemical attacks, especially in the Syrian Douma. In a joint statement, Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America called for an end to the unacceptable Russian defamation of the OPCW.",

On April 25 2019, the Verkhovna Rada passed the law 'on ensuring the functioning of the Ukrainian language as a state language'. The law establishes mandatory use of the Ukrainian language in most areas of public and communal life, including the mass media, education, science, etc. However, the law does not forbid the use of Russian, or other languages, in private communication and religious ceremonies. Moreover, Russian and other languages can be present in book publishing, the press, including radio and television, education and the service sector. The law also allows the use of other languages in the healthcare system and law enforcement. In addition to this,\u00a0the law stipulates\u00a0that in accordance with the European Charter for Regional Languages and Languages of National Minorities, the government should develop a law safeguarding language-rights of the minorities within six months of the language law entering into force.",

Naive enthusiasts of \u201cInternational judiciary\u201d believed that the ICC prepared charges against the terrorists of \u201cBoko Haram\u201d. But no charges have been filed under more than ten years of \u201cinvestigations\u201d. From the latest report of the ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda we can learn that the army of Nigeria is persecuting\u2026 supporters of \u201cBoko Haram\u201d. ICC is in reality defending the terrorists against the government\u2019s forces. The advance of ISIS in the world generally and in Africa particularly is a result of coordinated actions of institutes for global control, like the International Criminal Court, using this terrorist organisation as their armed branch.",

            "content": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative claiming that the US and other Western states are supporting or working together with terrorists. Read here similar cases claiming that\u00a0ISIS has been supported by US, British, French and Israeli intelligence services in order to demolish Syria\u00a0and that\u00a0Al Baghdadi was an American product. As regards the Nigerian case, the ICC has launched a preliminary examination of the the situation in Nigeria since November 2010 (n.b. The ICC has not launched a official investigation). From a legal perspective, no substantive field investigation is under way. Analysts (not investigators) have mostly relied on open source reporting and voluntary interviews with other IOs and NGOs, in order to establish if the Nigerian authorities are appropriately investigating incidents reported to them. There are several steps that need to be taken in the preliminary investigation before the Chief Prosecutor can eventually ask for the authorisation to open an official investigation (based on Article 15 of the ICC Statute). If the CP decides that there exists a reasonable basis upon which to open an investigation, it will not be based on her initiative, but rather she will have to launch a \u201crequest for authorisation\u201d of the Pre-Trial Chamber. The Chief Prosecutor apparently intends to make a decision on the merits of the preliminary investigation by the end of her term later this year. Often preliminary investigations may be used in order to maintain pressure on the authorities to continue reporting on the conflict, and to continue investigating possible cases of violations. In the case of Nigeria, the ICC has considered incidents on both sides of the conflict, including possible violations committed by Boko Haram, and Nigerian security forces between 2010 and now. In her report, ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda has strongly condemned Boko Haram for performing war crimes: According to findings previous published, the Office found that there was a reasonable basis to believe that since 2009 members of Boko Haram had committed crimes against humanity of murder and persecution (page 48). However, the report also notes that the Nigerian Security Forces, NSF, may also have performed war crimes: With respect to the NSF, the information assessed during the reporting period provides a reasonable basis to believe that members of the Civilian Joint Task Force (\u201cCJTF\u201d) committed the war crime of conscripting and enlisting children under the age of fifteen years into armed groups and using them to participate actively in hostilities pursuant to article 8(2)(e)(vii) of the Statute (Page 49). There is a considerable amount of information about the investigation available at\u00a0https://www.icc-cpi.int/nigeria\u00a0and at present the focus seems to be on establishing whether or not the ICC has sufficient jurisdiction to act further. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Pro-Kremlin outlets began portraying the OPCW as a pawn in Western geopolitical designs around mid-2018, when the organisation was being granted new powers to assign blame for chemical attacks, especially in the Syrian Douma. In a joint statement, Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America called for an end to the unacceptable Russian defamation of the OPCW.",

There is no evidence that the US or other Western states have supported ISIS/Daesh in Syria and Iraq. In reality, the US and its European allies are committed to fighting terrorist organisations, such as Daesh and Al-Qaeda. The US-led military campaign in Syria fought ISIS/Daesh along with the Global Coalition Against Daesh. Ever since the September 11 terrorist attacks the US and its European allies have been engaged in an enormous military and intelligence effort to counter Al Qaeda, ISIS and other radical Islamist terrorist groups around the world. It is also false that the US and other Western governments are complicit with, or indifferent to, Jihadist attacks against Christians in the Middle East.\u00a0 In March 2016, the US State Department recognised that ISIS was responsible for genocide against Christians, Yazidis, and Shiite Muslims. In February 2016, the European Parliament denounced the systematic mass murder of Christians and other religious minorities in Syria and Iraq by ISIS/Daesh. Similar cases include that ISIS has been supported by US, British, French and Israeli intelligence services in order to demolish Syria, that the US and Europe support Jihadist forces in Syria, and that Al Baghdadi was an American product.",

In 2017, Poland introduced new laws to ban totalitarian propaganda. According to this Law, up to 230 Soviet monuments may be replaced, a decision to be made by Polish local authorities. The Polish MFA underlines that Red Army burial places and cemeteries situated in Poland will be carefully protected. It is possible to dismantle and remove only symbolic monuments to the Red Army. In 2015, Pawe\u0142 Ukielski, Deputy Head of the Polish Institute of Historical Remembrance, published an open letter to the Russians, where he explained the need to remove the symbolic monuments to the Red Army from Polish public places (text in Polish and Russian). According to him, free Poland perceives these monuments as symbols of captivity by the totalitarian USSR. In some cases, the Soviet monuments glorify the Red Army generals, who were involved in military crimes against the Poles. The Polish Government does not implement the centralised policy of replacement of the Red Army monuments, such decisions are taken by the local authorities. Read similar cases connected to the issue of the Red Army monuments - Monuments to Soviet soldiers are massively demolished and damaged in Ukraine, Poland and Baltic countries; Removal of the monument to Marshall Konev is a violation of the Czech-Russian Agreement of 1993; A monument to the Soviet soldier-liberator demolished in Lithuania.",

The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine reported 8,500 ceasefire violations during the period from 27 January - 9 February. It recorded 26 weapons in violation of their withdrawal lines: three in the Ukrainian government-controlled side and 23 in areas outside governmental control. The Mission observed anti-tank mines on both sides of the contact line. Based on the report of 15 February 2020, the SMM has recorded more than 140 ceasefire violations, most of which took place on the \"non-governmental-controlled areas\". In many cases, separatists from the self-proclaimed DNR and LNR violated\u00a0the Minsk agreements, not the Ukrainian side, with the so-called elections organised there in\u00a0February 2018\u00a0as one of the examples.

The UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet described the attacks in northeastern Syria aimed at retaking key areas in Idlib and Aleppo as both \"indiscriminate\" and \"inhumane\". \u201cCivilians fleeing the fighting are being squeezed into areas without safe shelter that are shrinking in size by the hour. And still, they are bombed. They simply have nowhere to go,\u201d Bachelet said. From 1 to 16 February, the UN Human Rights Office recorded at least 100 civilian deaths, including 18 women and 35 children, and many other civilians were injured as a result of the air-strikes and ground-based strikes by government forces and their allies. In total, since the start of 2020, the UN Human Rights Office has recorded the deaths of 298 civilians in Idlib and Aleppo. Around 93 percent of those deaths were caused by the Syrian Government and its allies, including Russian airstrikes. In addition, 10 medical facilities and 19 educational facilities were either directly hit or affected by nearby strikes. According to UN estimates, more than 900,000 people, of whom about 80 percent are women and children, have been displaced since 1 December 2019. This is the largest displacement of people since the conflict began in 2011. Many displacement camps were directly and indirectly hit by government and pro-government forces. See a case here on how the Syrian army had never used chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict and how the Russians never target civilian populations deliberately.",

Sputnik uses footage showing a post published by a Facebook user, Oksana Bondarenko (now Laim\u012bg\u0101s Stundas) on December 14, 2019. The author of the post indicated T\u012bn\u016b\u017eu pagasts as a location which is in Ik\u0161\u0137ile municipality, in the central part of the country, some 200 km away from Daugavpils, where the NATO base is located. Another footage that we see in the video, which according to Sputnik, shows the current protests in Latvia, is from 2016. That year, on June 6, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment arrived in Daugavpils and conducted a training operation Dragoon Ride. It was that day when Representatives of the Latvian Armed Forces and Police removed the poster with text attacking US soldiers in Latvia. An administrative case has been initiated for placing a poster without permission. Then-President of Latvia Raimonds V\u0113jonis later said in his TV statement\u00a0that this was an isolated incident and did not reflect the general attitudes of Latvians. See more debunking by Myth Detector. Read here similar cases claiming that Lithuania is temporarily NATO-occupied territory ruled by non-Lithuanians, that Eastern European countries in NATO are under Washington\u2019s political and military control, that the US views the Baltic states not as independent countries but as a NATO springboard for conducting a military attack against Belarus and Russia, and that the Baltic states are dying because they chose not to be with Russia.",

You can read other similar cases as\u00a0\"Ukraine does not fulfil key point of Minsk agreements on negotiation with the \"LDNR\"\u00a0or\u00a0\"Ukraine broke the Minsk agreements by allowing the National Police on the contact line\". At the end of January 2020, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a resolution on the status of the monitoring procedure, where Russia was named as a \u201cparty to the Minsk agreements\u201d. The PACE resolution noted that the Russian authorities should, among other things, \u201cfully implement the Minsk agreements to which the Russian Federation is a party and to end its military intervention in, and support for, illegally armed formations in Eastern Ukraine.\" Since 2014, negotiations with Russia to resolve the conflict in the Donbas have been held within the framework of the Normandy Format and the\u00a0Minsk process. A special\u00a0Trilateral\u00a0contact group\u00a0is working on a peaceful settlement of the situation in Donbas. Three parties are involved in this process: representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE. Unofficially, representatives of the \"LDNR\" factions are also present. The second set of measures to implement the Minsk agreements was signed on\u00a012 February 2015. The first paragraph of the document relates to an immediate ceasefire. Next, it is necessary to withdraw heavy weapons, ensure OSCE monitoring, release prisoners, grant Donbas special status and hold local elections, provide amnesty to the parties involved in the conflict and restore control over the Ukrainian-Russian border in the conflict zone. There are no conditions that the Ukrainian authorities should conduct direct negotiations with the leaders of the \"LDNR\" factions in the Minsk agreements.",

The referendum has nothing to do with the Istanbul Convention. Under the proposed amendments, the Constitutional court\u2019s chairman and six other members appointed by former Armenian governments would be replaced by other judges to be confirmed by the current parliament. The chairman and members of the CC are accused of having remaining links to the \u201cformer corrupt regime\u201d. The claim that the current Constitutional Court would never give a positive opinion about the Istanbul Convention is manipulation. The Armenian Ministry of Justice clarifies that the Convention does not threaten Armenia's traditional values. The Convention states that traditions, cultures and religion cannot justify violence against women. In addition, the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe issued an opinion that \"there are no provisions in that Convention that could be said to 'contradict' the Constitution of Armenia.\" Other disinformation cases about the Istanbul Convention are available here. Read similar cases claiming that the Istanbul Convention will destroy traditional families and that it is attacking identity and traditions, that an influx of 50 000 perverts is expected from abroad and that Istanbul convention is a threat to the Armenian Army.",

It is also a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative portraying the economic situation of Ukraine as disastrous. European integration is defined by the Ukrainian authorities as a priority. On 11 February 2020, Prime Minister of Ukraine, Oleksiy Honcharuk, met with EU Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations, Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi, and discussed priorities for Ukraine-EU bilateral cooperation for 2020. At the moment, the association agreement is the main tool for bringing Ukraine and the EU closer together. It promotes deeper political ties, stronger economic links and respect for common values. The deep and comprehensive free trade area (DCFTA) is the economic part of the agreement. It offers a framework for modernising Ukraine's economy and trade relations. A joint press release by the EU-Ukraine Association Council on 28 January 2020 \"reaffirmed the continued commitment of the parties to strengthening the political association and economic integration of Ukraine with the European Union on the basis of the Association Agreement and its Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area and to the common values enshrined in it.\" Regarding the claim about Ukraine's economy being disastrous, according to the World Bank, the GDP of Ukraine grew by 3.5% in the first half of 2019, compared to 3.3% in 2018. The solid growth was driven by a strong agricultural harvest, as well as sectors dependent on domestic demand, including services (domestic trade, transport, and the financial sector) and construction. In 2019, the GDP of Ukraine was US$130.832 billion. Thirty years ago it was $82.709 billion - an increase of over 50 percent.

EU sanctions against Russia were imposed after illegal actions by the Russian Federation, including the annexation of Crimea, and against persons that have been involved in the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity. In March 2015, the European Council linked the duration of economic restrictions to the complete implementation of the Minsk agreements. The EU remains ready to ease sanctions when Russia starts contributing actively to the implementation of the Minsk agreements. \u201cRussophobia\u201d is a manipulative defensive line, often used by Russian propaganda to delegitimise any criticism of Russian policies or the state by implying that such criticism derives from an irrational intolerance of the Russian people. Outlets such as RT,\u00a0Sputnik\u00a0and\u00a0Russian national state television use the term to portray almost any foreign criticism of the Kremlin's policies.

The disinformation message appeared in the background of a recently published\u00a0report\u00a0by the True Animal Protein Price Coalition, which was presented at the beginning of February in the European Parliament. The report\u00a0urges the EU to adopt a meat tax to tackle climate emergency. Many European lawmakers backed\u00a0the report calling for a new meat pricing model to be included in the European Green Deal and the EU\u2019s new food policy, the\u00a0Farm to Fork Strategy. The proposal, however, is still on the\u00a0discussion\u00a0stage. Poverty reduction is a key policy component of the Europe 2020 strategy for growth and jobs. As statistics show, the number of people at poverty or social inclusion is constantly decreasing since 2012. 2020 goal for the EU is to reach 96.1 million. In the period between 2002 and 2018, the unemployment rate for the total population aged 15-74 decreased by 2.2 percentage points (p.p.) in the, back then, EU-28, from 9.0 % to 6.8 %. As for terrorism, the EU has adopted an EU counter-terrorism strategy back in 2005. EU considers terrorism as one of the main threats to its freedom and security. Following the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack, the Commission established European Counter Terrorism Centre (ECTC) to improve the exchange of information and the operational support to Member States' investigators. The Commission also runs Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN). The key focus goes on countering the financing of terrorism, protection of critical infrastructure, security research projects, etc. See more on EU counter-terrorism efforts here.",

            "content": "This is a coronavirus-related conspiracy theory aimed to discredit the West and the so-called Anglo-Saxons. In the pro-Kremlin media, the term \u201cAnglo-Saxons\u201d means \u201cevil\u201d, \u201cbelligerent\u201d and \u201cmorally corrupt\u201d Westerners, as explained by our earlier analysis. The Opium Wars were a dark page in the British Empire and, more generally, in the West's history. However, the parallels with the current coronavirus epidemic are unfounded and only serve to groundlessly imply that the West purposefully uses it against China to reach economic and political goals. The current coronavirus (2019-nCoV) comes from a family of viruses that include other viruses such as SARS and MERS. It was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in central China and has been rapidly spreading with new cases being reported in the Asian-Pacific region as well as Europe, North America and the Middle East, causing more than 700 deaths by 10th February 2020. The identity of the animal source of the coronavirus, named nCoV-2019, has been one of the key questions for researchers. Coronaviruses are known to circulate in mammals and birds, and scientists have already suggested that nCoV-2019 originally came from bats. One of the previous coronaviruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, spread from bats to civet cats to humans. Two researchers from the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou have recently identified the pangolin as the potential source of nCoV-2019. This was announced to reporters at a press conference on 7th February 2020. See earlier disinformation cases alleging that coronavirus was created on purpose, probably by the same British lab which poisoned the Skripals, that coronavirus is the West\u2019s revenge for China refusing to become hostile towards Russia, and that coronavirus is a Western tool to attack Chinese economy.",

            "description": "There is evidence that the coronavirus was created on purpose. First of all, both the US and the UK have announced the existence of a vaccine. But any expert knows that it\u2019s not possible to create a vaccine against a virus, which was never seen before. In UK the Porton Down laboratory, a quite well known organisation which has been dealing with chemical and biological weapons for a long time has said they already have the vaccine. According to media, they have patented it already one year ago! This is the same organisation which put the poison on the Skripals\u2019 door handle. Probably they put something also over the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, for example, on the door handle of the subway, or rather not the door handle but this one [thing, object]\u00a0 which is being touched by thousands of people. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t exclude such a situation. It can be an act of biological sabotage, it might have been carried out not by a State, for example, the US, but by certain private corporations. The appearance of such beneficiaries able to go on market already tomorrow with an already made vaccine is a not direct proof of that.",

In total, four draft labour laws are under consideration in the Ukrainian Parliament. The final version of the law in question is not yet set, as discussions in the Verkhovna Rada are still ongoing. However, Economy Minister Tymofiy Mylovanov explained that while the Labour Bill does refer to the possibility of dismissing an employee on the initiative of the employer, this must not happen without an explanation of the reason. Moreover, Mylovanov wrote on his Facebook page, current legislation offers no material protections for employees who have been dismissed: according to the current code, there are ten reasons to dismiss an employee, and an employer can do so without bearing any financial responsibility for this decision. Under the new Labour Law, however, material compensation for dismissed employees would be made mandatory, also to discourage the transformation of business enterprises under false pretences for the sake of staff reduction. For the relevant excerpt of the bill explaining these provisions, see here. For similar cases misrepresenting Ukrainian reform legislation, see for example here, here, and here.",

At that time, sanctions were introduced against entities doing business with Russian military or intelligence agencies, companies involved in Russian off-shore oil projects, and those participating in Russian oil or gas pipeline construction within Russia. The economic sanctions imposed on Russia were a reaction to Russia's illegal annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Sanctions were imposed not only by the United States but also by Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the European Union and other European countries outside the EU, including Ukraine.",

Recently, the Dutch-led investigative group has not been able to come up with any new evidence in this case. There are more and more spectacular statements accusing Russia and revolutionaries in the Donbass for the downing of the jet. While Dutch investigators have been unable to bring any new evidence, indirect facts have surfaced that suggest the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) had something to do with the downing of the Malaysian Boeing. Based on this, we can say that the tragedy was not simple negligence but an operation specifically benefiting Kiev and Washington, \u201cwho has not shown the world the satellite image ever since.\u201d Expert Yuri Antipov reviewed the photos taken at the crash site and found that no \u201cBUK missile\u201d was involved in the accident, instead, he said, the \u201ccharacteristics of the debris\u201d suggest there was an explosion on the inside.

Theories that the accident was a plot to blame Russia, the involvement of Ukraine and that there is evidence a bomb exploded inside the plane have been among the many disinformation narratives the Kremlin have spread about the tragedy since 2014. A special team, known as the\u00a0Joint Investigation Team (JIT), was established to conduct the criminal investigation\u00a0of the downing of the Malaysian Airlines flight MH17. The JIT comprises officials from the Dutch Public Prosecution Service and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. The JIT has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy. At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was\u00a0taken\u00a0back to the Russian Federation.\u00a0The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT), has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17, originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. The prosecution of 4 suspects begins on 9th of March 2020, as decided by the Dutch Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (PPO), which has the unanimous support of the investigation authorities of the other countries in the Joint Investigation Team (JIT): Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. The PPO will present the case to an independent court in a public hearing under the Dutch legal system. See previous disinformation narratives alleging that\u00a0MH17 was a false flag attack, planned by British and Ukrainian security agencies, that\u00a0Ukraine conceals evidence confirming its guilt, while\u00a0Ukrainian secret service manipulated a sound recording in the MH17 investigation.",

One of the most prominent cases in which the expression \u201chighly likely\u201d has been used by Western authorities is the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergey Skripal and his daughter Yulia with Novichok, as in UK prime minister Theresa May\u2019s letter to the UN Security Council on March 2018, after the British investigation had established that either the Russian Government was behind the attack or it had lost control of the nerve agent to a non-State actor. Since then, the only relevant suspects of the case have been identified as operatives of the Russian military intelligence service (GRU). You can see other examples of disinformation about Russia\u2019s alleged innocence in our database, such as claims about false UK and US accusations for the downing of the flight MH17, the Mueller report as proof of how Russia is always falsely blamed, the annexation of Crimea as the will of its population and in full compliance of international law, the Skripal case as a sham, the recurrent accusations of Russophobia or anti-Russian stances, or the affirmation that is NATO, not Russia, who is involved in the Donbass conflict.",

The \"Right Sector\" candidate received 0.7% of the vote in the May 2014 presidential elections and the party received 1.8% of the vote in the October 2014 parliamentary elections.

Far-right groups have nothing to do with Ukrainian plans to join NATO or to provide language reform in the country.

According to the Eurobarometer Survey, published in 2019, Serbia is the only Western Balkan country whose citizens have more trust in the national government (41%) than in the European Union (33%). In North Macedonia, these figures are 57% for EU and 33% for the national government, in Albania 69% to 40% and the result in Montenegro is 47% to 43%. There is strong support to the EU membership across the Western Balkans, except in Serbia. According to research conducted by National Democratic Institue in 2018, 72% of Bosnia and Herzegovina citizens, 69% of North Macedonia citizens, 55% of Montenegrins and 45% of Serbian citizens would vote \"For\", if the referendum for EU membership of their country was held. Read similar disinformation message claiming that EU enlargement on Western Balkans will not happen.",

This does not prevent the West from blaming the militia of Donbas and Russia for what happened.

Such a situation does not suit the Russian Federation, nor Malaysia, whose authorities have already announced that the investigation is political in nature and its true purpose is to blame Russia. It [Western position] can be very shaky if a German detective, who conducted his own independent investigation, attends the meeting.

A special team, known as the\u00a0Joint Investigation Team (JIT), was established to conduct the criminal investigation of the downing of the Malaysian Airlines flight in 2014. On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, the Dutch Public Persecution service will prosecute 4 individuals for causing the MH17 crash, murdering all 289 persons on board. The trial will start in March 2020 at The Hague District Court. The suspects to be prosecuted are Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinsky, Oleg Pulatov, and Leonid Kharchenko. A German private detective has claimed to have evidence about the crash of the plane. In 2016, he was questioned by the Dutch police as a witness in the case. The prosecutors believe that the detective was contacted by people who might be involved in the crash. The \"evidence\" claimed by Russia, namely radar data and the \"field experiment\" conducted by the Russian military company Almaz-Antey, is only a small sample of misleading claims\u00a0advanced by Moscow since 2015, some of which have\u00a0contradicted one another. The JIT has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series,\u00a0launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy (or: Pervomaiskyi). At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was taken back to the Russian Federation. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT), has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17, originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation.

            "description": "Russia has become locked in a dispute with Poland and the Baltic States over the origins of WWII after the European Parliament passed a resolution in September on the history of the conflict. The resolution claimed that the 1939 non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany led to the start of the war. The responsibility for WWII lies with the Polish elite who ruled the country in the 30s, who were the first to conclude a non-aggression pact with Hitler in 1934, who were allied to him, who participated in the division of Czechoslovakia with Hitler and who received territorial acquisitions from the Munich conspiracy when Czechoslovakia was surrendered to Hitler. Historians in the West, in Poland, in Europe, in the USA even earlier have held the point of view that allegedly the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact initiated the Second World War.",

            "content": "This message is a part of the ongoing Russian disinformation campaign against Poland claiming that Poland was a Nazi ally and was the main instigator of WWII. This narrative claims that Poland can only blame itself because its alleged provocatory behaviour towards the the Soviet Union was a key factor in the Soviet leadership\u2019s decision to sign the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and also in triggering German and Soviet attacks on Poland in September 1939. The accusations that Poland was a Nazi ally and posed a \u201cmilitary threat\u201d to the USSR are not confirmed by any available historical documents. Before WWII, Poland had tense political relations with Nazi Germany, which had open territorial claims to Poland (revision of the status of the Free City of Danzig and control over the \u201cPolish Corridor\u201d). Despite intense political pressure from Hitler, Poland refused to become a part of the Nazi block. The accusation that the Polish authorities, by their refusal to allow Soviet troops to enter their territory, forced the Soviet leadership to sign the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and triggered the Soviet army's subsequent intervention in Poland in September 1939 is a clear historical manipulation. It is a fact\u00a0that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the\u00a0Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. The agreement to create a new German-Soviet border in the middle of Poland, as well as to consign Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland to a \u201cSoviet sphere of interest\u201d, was part of the secret protocol. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact directly caused the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in its complete occupation by Germany and the USSR. Soviet ethnic cleansing of Eastern Poland and the Baltic states began immediately after the invasion with the arrest of hundreds of thousands of Poles and Balts and their deportation to concentration camps and settlements in the east. Read similar cases claiming that Poland was an ally of Nazi Germany and had a role in the outbreak of World War II that some European countries, especially Poland, had conspired with Nazi Germany, that Poland posed a military threat to the USSR in 1938-39 that the Soviet Union was forced and reluctant to sign the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.",

This legalisation was prepared by Members of Parliament and submitted in October 2019. According to the voting procedure, other MPs have filed their suggestions to the document. The draft law, inter alia, excludes foreigners and foreign companies from buying land and limits the amount of land each person can buy and own. Therefore, the claim in the article that one bank or person could buy a lot of territories in Ukraine is false according to the new proposed law. On the contrary, it is indicated that a single citizen or a company can possess no more than 0.5% of the land in Ukraine. Regarding the claims about Soros, in reality, the Soros \"Open Society Foundation\", which is inspired by Karl Popper\u2019s concept of the \u201copen society\u201d, aims to promote civil society, the rule of law, human rights and liberal democracy around the world by funding civil society groups.\u00a0The International\u00a0Renaissance Foundation, a Ukrainian NGO founded by Soros, played an important role in supporting civil society during the Euromaidan protests. The foundation ensured that legal aid was made available throughout the crisis to civic activists, protesters, and journalists; supplied victims of violence with medical care; enabled civil society solidarity and organisation; supported channels like Hromadske TV in independent, live reporting about events on the Maidan; and documented cases of torture, beatings, and police and abuse by the courts.

            "description": "American military and politicians like \u201cAnaconda\u201d strategy. They surround Russia and China with hundreds of military bases and make an illusion of creating a blocking ring. Americans also create client regimes along the perimeter of Russian borders. The US State Secretary Mike Pompeo was allured to visit Belarus because of Alyaksandr Lukashenka\u2019s actions countering the Union State of Belarus and Russia. The US aims to use the opportunity of making Belarus Russophobic. By adding Belarus into the chain of Russophobic regimes the US would reach information and ideological victory over Russia. In 2014, in Kyiv, they also tried to implement its \u201cAnaconda\u201d plan by cutting Donbas off Russian border and crushing its forces afterwards. The plan was obviously elaborated by US advisers, as Soviet military academies taught different tactics. Indeed, the correctness of Soviet military doctrine was well demonstrated in Donbas when overwhelming Ukrainian forces where cut into pieces, surrounded and destroyed by much weaker units of local militia and soldiers on leave.",

This makes economic and political relations uncomfortable. Even the UK experienced certain problems with the approach of the EU and was forced to endure while being an EU member. As a result of the aggressive policy of the EU, many areas of cooperation were destroyed. This signal, first of all, should be heard in Brussels.",

The unique feature of the EU is that, although the Member States\u00a0remain sovereign and independent states, they have decided to pool some of their 'sovereignty' in areas where it makes sense to work together.\u00a0The decision-making structure in the EU is defined by the EU treaties.\u00a0 Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union ensures the principle of subsidiarity, which guarantees that decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen. Learn more here. The reference to an aggressive policy in this article refers to sanctions against Russia. These were adopted in response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and the deliberate destabilisation of Ukraine. On 12 December 2019, EU leaders unanimously agreed to roll over the economic sanctions on Russia for another six months, until\u00a031 July 2020. As set out in the Withdrawal Agreement, EU sanctions will continue to apply in the UK during the transition period until 11 pm on 31 December 2020. The EU\u2019s foreign and security policy, designed to resolve conflicts and foster international understanding, is based on diplomacy and respect for international rules.

Polish President announced that he would not participate in the 5th Holocaust Forum in Jerusalem, scheduled for the 23rd of January 2020 in Yad Vashem Institute in Israel because the organisers did not invite him to speak at the event, while the Russian president was invited as a speaker. B\u0142a\u017cej Spychalski, a spokesman for Duda, told Polish news outlets that \"a situation in which the president of Poland will sit and listen to the false words of President Putin without being able to reply is unacceptable.\" The Polish president spoke on the 27th of January at the Auschwitz Museum, at a ceremony marking the anniversary of the liberation of the camp, stating that Poles are well aware of the truth about what was happening in Auschwitz since it was recounted to them by their compatriots who had camp numbers tattooed on their bodies by Germans. Read similar disinformation cases claiming that Warsaw supported Hitler\u2019s plan to expel Polish Jews to Africa and that Poland is a country which does not want to condemn anti-Semitism.",

In May 2019, OPCW documents were leaked, confirming the validity of Russian conclusions and putting the report\u2019s findings into question. The organization has launched an investigation into the information leak and has accused two of its employees, whose names have not been released, of leaking sensitive information.",

            "content": "This claim tries to show sanctions against Russia, due to its illegal actions in Ukraine, as\u00a0unfair persecution\u00a0against Sputnik and its employees, and against media freedom in general. Estonia is ranked as the\u00a011th freest country\u00a0in the world for press by Reporters Without Borders. Estonia is considered a\u00a0consolidated democracy\u00a0by Freedom House and a Flawed Democracy by the Economist Intelligence Unit's\u00a0Democracy Index. Thus, Estonia is by no means a regime that pressures opposition or those who represent a point of view inconsistent with the country's domestic and foreign policies. Regarding censorship, Estonia has not blocked Sputnik Estonia's website and it is accessible. The Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu has emphasized that Estonia has not taken any measures against the portal's media content: \"They are financial sanctions aimed at economic activity. I believe it to be justified. We have notified the European Commission's Legal Service. European agencies have said in the Commission that steps taken by Estonia in exercising sanctions policy are warranted.\" The Article 2 of the Council Regulation\u00a0(EU) No 269/2014\u00a0on the territorial integrity of Ukraine foresees freezing the assets of Dmitry Kiselyov, the Director-General of Rossija Segodnya. According to the\u00a0articles of association of the company, the Director-General has the right to decide upon opening bank accounts and carry out invoicing. This corresponds to the condition \"having the right to use all or part of the assets of a legal person or entity\" in the EU Best Practices for the\u00a0effective implementation of restrictive measures. As for the participation of Brits in the Estonian decision, this conspiracy theory is based on the concept that countries or organisations are not independent but under the control of other countries or organisations. Examples of such disinformation narratives include NATO's Eastern European members are under Washington\u2019s political and military control\u00a0or\u00a0The Economist is a mouthpiece of the Rothschilds and Europe is a puppet of Washington.",

The resolutions of the Polish and Lithuanian Parliaments regarding WWII do not question the status of Russia as a country, which had won in this war as it is a fact \u2013 these resolutions are aimed at the criticism of two totalitarian regimes, which started WWII in 1939. On January 9, the Polish Parliament adopted the resolution \u201ccondemning the provocative and untrue statements by representatives of the highest authorities of the Russian Federation attempting to hold Poland liable for the Second World War\u201d. The Polish Parliament states that World War II was started by two totalitarian powers, which on 23 August 1939 signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. After Germany invaded Poland from the west on September 1, 1939, Soviet troops invaded Poland from the east on September 17. The main goal of this resolution is to prevent Russia from hampering the historical dialogue between Russia and other nations.

As of February 7, there were 28 countries affected by the new disease with almost 40,000 cases confirmed. The biggest number of infected people were detected in China, Japan and Singapore.

The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine has been the cornerstone of Russian disinformation about the country since the beginning of the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests, when it was used to discredit the pro-European popular uprising in Kyiv and, subsequently, the broader pro-Western shift in Ukraine's foreign policy. The accusation of Nazism is one of the favourite techniques of pro-Kremlin outlets, read our past analysis\u00a0Nazi east, Nazi west, Nazi over the cuckoo's nest. Ukraine does not follow any anti-Russian agenda. The relationships between Ukraine and Russia are defined by international agreements, including the UN Charter which requires states to respect the sovereignty of other states and the Friendship Treaty between the two countries. However, the relations severely deteriorated after the Russian illegal annexation of Crimea. The Kremlin provoked other events, including the war in Donbas and the seizure of the Ukrainian ships in the Kerch strait in November 2018, that undermined the bilateral relations. See similar narratives alleging that Euromaidan was a coup led by the fascists; EU accepts a Kyiv government, filled to the brim with Nazis; Poland, Ukraine and the Baltic authorities associate themselves with Hitler; and Ukraine is an anti-Russian project of the CIA.",

The law on the land market, which is currently debated in the Verkhovna Rada, was prepared by Members of Parliament and submitted in October 2019. According to the voting procedure, other MPs have filed their suggestions to the document. The draft law, inter alia, excludes foreigners and foreign companies from buying land and limits the amount of land each person can buy and own. The first deputy head of the National Bank of Ukraine said recently that the IMF believes that the land market should be one of the key economic reforms in Ukraine, however, it does not specify the provisions of the law regulating the market. The economy minister also mentioned that neither the IMF nor the World Bank specify precisely what provisions must be in the new law.

Sea Breeze is an annually recurring multinational exercise, it does not aim, nor threaten, to invade any territory or to exert any pressure. Sea Breeze exercises are intended to become one of the important tools for the transition of the Ukrainian Navy to NATO's standards. Twenty countries will participate in the Sea Breeze exercise in 2020, which is traditionally organised by Ukraine and the United States, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine has said. \u201cIt is important that new participants, such as Japan and South Korea, joined in the exercise this year. The Norwegian Armed Forces will also participate in the ground-based part of Sea Breeze for the first time,\u201d Ukrainian co-chief of the exercise, First Rank Captain Oleksiy Doskato said. The multinational staff of specialists from Bulgaria, Great Britain, Georgia, Denmark, Estonia, Canada, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Norway, Poland, Romania, Turkey and Sweden will agree on the future manoeuvres concept in Odesa within a week.",

One of the inspectors, reffered to as \u201cInspector A\u201d and \u201cInspector B\u201d, was former OPCW specialist Ian Henderson, who visited Douma as part of the agency\u2019s fact-finding mission and has publicly blasted the \u201csanitised\u201d report on the alleged Douma attack. The other \u2018Inspector\u2019 was presumably a reference to \u2018Alex\u2019, an elusive whistleblower whose identity has not been revealed, and who has provided materials to WikiLeaks similarly casting major doubt on the OPCW\u2019s integrity in its investigation of the alleged Douma attack.",

            "content": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives attacking the independence and integrity of the OPCW; lending credence to the claim that the 2018 Douma attack was staged; and absolving the Syrian regime of responsibility for chemical attacks in general. The story is peppered with falsehoods and out-of-context citations lifted from the OPCW website. It conveniently omits the fact that the quoted remarks were not ad-hoc verbal attacks on the \"whistleblowers,\" but were made on the heels of an independent OPCW probe (not an internal review) which took six months to carry out and was overseen by external investigators.\u00a0 The probe does not name the leakers but provides just enough information to disprove the claim that Henderson \"visited Douma as part of the agency\u2019s fact-finding mission.\" Inspector A \"was not a member of the FFM\" and \"played a minor supporting role in the investigation of the Douma incident\" (para. 13). Inspector B, on the other hand, \"never left the command post in Damascus because he had not completed the training required to deploy to the field\" (para. 23). It follows that neither inspector could have visited the site with a fact-finding mandate. See here for a comprehensive debunking of Henderson's claims. Additionally, Sputnik never mentions that Inspector B \"departed [from the agency] at the end of August 2018\" (para. 25) and could not have possibly participated in the last seven months of the Douma investigation, during which \"the majority of the [FFM's] investigative work was conducted\" (para. 29). This fits the timing of Alex's leaked e-mail, which is dated 22 June 2018 and could not have possibly addressed the final version of the Douma report. In fact, the concerns raised in the e-mail were addressed in the final report, published in March 2019. See here for additional debunking by Bellingcat.",

            "content": "This is a conspiracy theory. No evidence is given to support the claim. The impeachment process against US President Donald Trump was supported by all Democratic members of the House of Representatives in the first charge (abuse of power), and by all except two in the second charge (obstruction of Congress). There was near-universal consensus within the party to proceed with the impeachment process. The aim of the inquiry was to determine whether President Trump committed high crimes and misdemeanours by 1) pressing a foreign government (Ukraine's) to harm a domestic political rival, former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, and 2) trying to impede a Congressional investigation by blocking testimony and refusing to provide documents in response to House subpoenas. This story mixes two common pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives: the first alleges the existence of a Deep State or Shadow Government in the US whose aim is to weaken and demonise Russia and prevent good relations Washington and Moscow. The second is a conspiracy theory portraying George Soros as\u00a0an evil mastermind who is responsible for almost every problem, controversy, or political unrest in the world. In fact, the impeachment process was wholly unrelated to US-Russia relations, and George Soros played no role in it. Similar cases using these disinformation narratives include: NATO and the Deep State\u2019s war-preparation policy aims at hindering cooperation between Trump and Putin, the whistleblower who triggered the impeachment process was linked to George Soros, and Soros' sponsorship of the film \u201cJoker\u201d is a tutorial for future \u2018colour revolutions\u2019. Also see cases about Soros' many alleged misdeeds, such as his promotion of protests in Mexico, Catalonia, Romania,\u00a0Russia,\u00a0Armenia\u00a0or\u00a0Czech Republic (among many others), his destabilising manoeuvres all over the world, his various attempts to destabilise Europe (mainly through the promotion of mass migration), or his adoption of the term \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d\u00a0to discredit those who speak the truth.",

Created in February 2020, the International Religious Freedom Alliance was a logical continuation in the process of protecting religion in the United States. Starting with the idea of \u200b\u200bNational Prayer Breakfasts, which have been held in the States since 1953, it organised the 2nd Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom event on July 16 -18th 2019 during which U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the creation of the International Alliance of Religious Freedom. Six months later, another 26 countries joined the global alliance. Pompeo emphasised that \"freedom of religion or belief is not a Western ideal, but truly the foundation of society.\" There is no talk of \"protecting terrorists and extremists\"; on the contrary, the main task of the Alliance is to protect human rights on the basis of a number of Declarations ratified by most countries of the world, including Russia. Secretary of State Pompeo said the joint efforts of the partner countries are aimed at fighting, not supporting, \"terrorists and violent extremists which target religious minorities, whether they are Yezidis in Iraq, Hindus in Pakistan, Christians in northeast Nigeria, or Muslims in Burma.\" The \u201cDeclaration of Principles\u201d created by the Alliance offers \"reactive\" and \"proactive\" measures that participants can use to protect religious freedom around the world. It is emphasised that we are talking not only about the protection of Christianity, but also other, even the smallest religions.",

            "content": "Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative\u00a0that seeks to discredit the EU, claiming that the EU has abandoned genuine European values and traditions and is built on the worship of money and of free-markets. This narrative is consistent with the pro-Kremlin propaganda theme about decadent values and moral decay in contemporary Western societies. The article also repeats the recurring pro-Kremlin narrative that claims the EU seeks to rob European nations of their sovereignty and identity. It is not true that the EU is merely a \u201cmarket\u201d, nor that it has abandoned European values and aims to destroy national sovereignty. The European Union is a unique economic and political union between 27\u00a0EU countries that together cover much of the continent. The predecessor of the EU was created in the aftermath of the Second World War. The first steps were to foster economic cooperation: the idea being that countries that trade with one another become economically interdependent and therefore are more likely to avoid conflict. The result was the European Economic Community (EEC), created in 1958, and initially increasing economic cooperation between six countries: Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Since then, 22\u00a0other members joined and a huge\u00a0single market\u00a0(also known as the 'internal' market) has been created and continues to develop towards its full potential. What began as a purely economic union has evolved into an organization spanning different policy areas, from climate, environment and health to external relations and security, justice and migration. EU values are common to \u00a0EU countries in a society in which inclusion, tolerance, justice, solidarity and non-discrimination prevail. These values (Human dignity, Freedom, Democracy, Equality, Rule of law, Human rights) are an integral part of the European way of life. The European Parliament\u2019s\u00a0Spring 2019 Eurobarometer, measuring public attitudes to the EU three months ahead of the European elections, reveals that despite the various internal and external challenges to the EU of the past years, the European sense of togetherness does not seem to have weakened. Continued support for EU membership goes with a strong belief (68%) that EU countries overall have benefited from being part of the EU - equalling the highest level recorded since 1983. In addition, 61% of respondents say their country\u2019s EU membership is a good thing. Read similar cases attacking the EU by claiming that the EU is built on anti-European values while Russia upholds genuine European values, that\u00a0Europe is losing its values and former power that liberalism leads to the loss of national sovereignty.",

According to this policy, the Russian official historiography is the only \u201ctrue\u201d way of interpretation of historical events for the countries of Eastern and Central Europe. The recent statements of President Duda and President Zelenskyy regarding WWII history are based on historical facts, shared by the majority of historians. First of all, it is a historical fact that both\u00a0Nazi Germany\u00a0and the\u00a0Stalinist USSR were harsh totalitarian regimes, which directly caused the deaths of tens of millions of people. Secondly, these two regimes are mutually responsible for the outbreak of WWII. It is also a historical fact\u00a0that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the\u00a0Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of WWII. Read similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland - It is thanks to Russia that Poland today exists as a country,\u00a0Nazi Germany considered Poland its best ally,\u00a0USSR was forced and reluctant to sign Molotov-Ribbentrop pact\u00a0and\u00a0the Polish legions of Pilsudski organized the Volyn tragedy.",

The\u00a0Munich Agreement\u00a0(September 30, 1938), indeed, permitted German annexation of the Sudetenland in Western Czechoslovakia. The policy of appeasement towards Adolf Hitler was heavily criticised in Europe and proved to be a disastrous move.\u00a0World War II\u00a0began in Europe one year later, on 1 September 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. The signing of the\u00a0Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact\u00a0was a mutual decision of two totalitarian regimes (Nazi Germany\u00a0and the\u00a0Stalinist USSR) aimed at the division of Eastern and Central Europe between these two powers. It is a proven\u00a0historical fact\u00a0that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the\u00a0Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact enabled German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of WWII.

US Major General Andrew Rohling Deputy Commanding General for the US Army in Europe, informs that the US-led exercise \"Defender 2020\" is an American exercise with 18 NATO partner countries. Rohling emphasises that the aim of the exercise is not to target any country, but rather to test strategic readiness and how to react to a crisis. Exercise Defender-Europe 2020 is the deployment of a division-size combat-credible force from the United States to Europe, the drawing of equipment and the movement of personnel and equipment across the Atlantic to various training areas in Europe, like Germany and Poland. With US Defender Europe 2020, the 18 participating NATO-countries are therefore practising procedures to ensure and demonstrate the ability to relocate and also to confirm the alliance's commitment to supporting and, in particular, to show the United States' commitment to Europe's security. There are 37,000 participants - of which up to 20,000 from the USA are to be relocated to Europe - and takes place from January to May 2020. U.S. service members will then spread out across the region to establish intermediate staging bases with multinational forces and participate in various annual exercises.

It also contains recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about the West's deliberate anti-Russian activities, double standards and about Russophobia in the Baltic states. This claim tries to show sanctions against Russia, due to its illegal actions in Ukraine, as unfair persecution against Sputnik and its employees and against media freedom in general. Estonia ranks 11th \u00a0in the Reporters without Borders Press freedom index. Estonia has not blocked Sputnik Estonia's website. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Urmas Reinsalu has emphasised that Estonia has not taken any measures against the portal's media content: \"They are financial sanctions aimed at economic activity. I believe it to be justified. We have notified the European Commission's Legal Service. European agencies have said in the Commission that steps taken by Estonia in exercising sanctions policy are warranted.\" Article 2 of the Council Regulation (EU) No 269/2014 on the territorial integrity of Ukraine foresees freezing the assets of Dmitry Kiselyov, the Director-General of Rossiya Segodnya. As a result, Estonian banks froze accounts of Rossiya Segodnya and the Financial Intelligence Unit informed persons employed or contracted by Rossiya Segodnya that knowingly working for or providing services to a sanctioned person was forbidden. Sputnik\u00a0was created\u00a0by\u00a0a Presidential decree\u00a0with the aim to \u201creport on the state policy of Russia abroad\u201d.\u00a0Numerous reports\u00a0have described how\u00a0top managers\u00a0from all the large government-controlled outlets and some influential private media\u00a0attend weekly meetings where\u00a0\"media managers\u00a0receive guidelines that 'help' them not to overstep the Kremlin\u2019s so-called 'double white lines'.\" The EU vs Disinfo team has found 49 different Sputnik websites from all over the world and\u00a031 of them are represented in the Disinformation cases database. Moreover, there is no \"war propaganda\" against Russia in Western media; Exercise Defender-Europe 2020 poses no threat to Russia. Western media represent a wide range of opinions and do not follow a single editorial policy on any given topic. The freest countries in terms of press freedom are predominantly European countries, including Norway, Finland, Sweden, Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, Belgium, Estonia, Portugal, Germany.

You can see other examples of Kremlin-led disinformation narratives on the coronavirus outbreak in our database, such as claims that\u00a0Bill Gates\u00a0and\u00a0George Soros\u00a0are sponsoring it, that it is a\u00a0UK,\u00a0US\u00a0or\u00a0NATO creation\u00a0and Americans have\u00a0its cure, that it is\u00a0an artificial disease\u00a0which specifically\u00a0targets Chinese DNA, that it was created\u00a0with economic goals\u00a0while\u00a0big pharma companies\u00a0are spreading panic for their own profits,\u00a0that it is a biological weapon against Russia and China, that it will\u00a0wipe out Ukraine\u2019s population\u00a0in a few days or that it was predicted by\u00a0Nostradamus and others.",

You can see other examples of disinformation on this topic in our database, such as the alleged\u00a0persecution of Sputnik\u00a0in\u00a0totalitarian Estonia\u00a0due to its\u00a0truthful reporting\u00a0and\u00a0fear of its influence;\u00a0the allegedly\u00a0brave efforts of Sputnik\u00a0against intolerance in Lithuania; the supposed\u00a0violations of the rights of Russian journalists\u00a0in the US and the EU; the claims that\u00a0French media are not free, or the stories on\u00a0how nice is to be a journalist in Russia, unlike in Europe, because Russia is the\u00a0global champion of free speech. RT and Sputnik's purpose is not to inform the public but to produce narratives serving the Kremlin\u2019s purposes, regularly resorting to disinformation. In a resolution on November 23rd 2016, the European Parliament identified both RT and Sputnik as tools and instruments of the Kremlin\u2019s anti-EU campaign.",

Act No. 3005 On Military Consulting Activities was indeed registered for consideration by the Verkhovna Rada. The document proposes to allow Ukrainian military consulting companies to provide third parties and countries with services such as: training and transfer of combat experience to the armed forces, maintenance of military equipment, military construction, mine clearance, medical and security services, as well as mediation services - the peaceful settlement of military conflicts. (\u0410rticle 7) The bill emphasises that Ukrainian private armies are strictly forbidden to take part in hostilities during armed conflicts. They will also be prohibited from participating in operations aimed at overthrowing the constitutional system of the state and seizing power or territories. In addition, they are forbidden to cooperate in any areas and manifestations with the state recognised by the Verkhovna Rada as the aggressor: Russia, its representatives and citizens. Private armies are also prohibited from operating in Ukraine. (Article 9) That is why even if the Verkhovna Rada adopts this bill, private armies will not be able to take any part in the war in Donbas.",

No international body recognises the so-called referendum, announced on the 27th of February 2014, and held on 16th of March 2014. A year after the illegal annexation, Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted that the plan to annex Crimea was ordered weeks before the so-called referendum. The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has stated that \u201cthe situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. This international armed conflict began at the latest on 26 February 2014 when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of the Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government.\" On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution\u00a0in which it stated that the referendum in Crimea was\u00a0not valid\u00a0and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly\u00a0confirmed\u00a0its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea. The EU's\u00a0policy of non-recognition\u00a0of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol includes a set of restrictive measures against entities and individuals responsible for actions against Ukraine's territorial integrity.\u00a0In March 2019 on the fifth anniversary of Crimea's annexation,\u00a0the EU reiterated its position of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol. EU continues to stand in full solidarity with Ukraine, supporting its sovereignty and territorial integrity.",

More generally, this disinformation message is also in line with the current disinformation attack on Poland. \u201cRussophobia\u201d is a manipulative defensive line, often used by Russian propaganda to reduce any criticism of the Russian state to an irrational intolerance towards the Russian people. Outlets such as RT, Sputnik\u00a0and Russian national state television\u00a0use\u00a0the term\u00a0to explain\u00a0away\u00a0almost any foreign criticism\u00a0of\u00a0Kremlin policies. Read similar disinformation cases claiming that Russophobia is the main export of Lithuania and NATO is closing in on Russia's border, that the US and EU countries are Russophobic, that anti-Russian position helped NATO countries freeze a drift in different directions,\u00a0 that Russian threat is an invention, Poland wages an information war against Russia, Poland, the Baltic States and Ukraine are infected by Russophobia, and Anti-Russian hysteria gave birth to daemons such as fascism and Banderism.

Poland is often presented by pro-Kremlin outlets as a \u201cpuppet-state\u201d of the United States.\u00a0This narrative includes a message that the United States manipulates Poland and other European allies in order to carry out its anti-Russian policies. The statement that Poland is used by the United States to inspire a conflict with Russia is a\u00a0conspiracy theory. Poland is a sovereign state, which shapes its own foreign and domestic policies. Read similar cases alleging that\u00a0Polish policy towards Ukraine is shaped by the Americans\u00a0and that\u00a0the US keeps Poland on an anti-Russian leash, Poland is losing its independence, Poland\u2019s Eastern policy is dictated by the USA aiming to weaken Russia, The US uses Poland as a potential fuse and stimulator of a conflict with Russia.

            "content": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the illegal annexation of Crimea. Pompeo's words were misquoted by the Ukrainian portal \"New Time\" - \"Novoye Vremya\", which referred to Emine Dzhaparova, former First Deputy Minister of Information Policy of Ukraine. In the following hours, Emine Dzhaparova, who participated in the meeting as a Crimean Activist, denied any talks about the \"lost Crimea\" and the reports disseminated in media as unacceptable \"media manipulation\". The Novoye Vremya report was, later on, updated to clarify that: \"the sides discussed the issue of how to keep Crimea on international agenda.\" The quote has also been disputed by other journalists. On the same note,\u00a0Crimea did not \"return\" to Russia but was illegally annexed by Moscow. On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a\u00a0resolution\u00a0in which it stated that the referendum in Crimea was\u00a0not valid\u00a0and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly\u00a0confirmed\u00a0its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea. According to international law, Crimea is a part of Ukraine. Russia violated international law as well as key principles of the European security framework by\u00a0illegally annexing\u00a0the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol in 2014.

The demonstrations which began in Kyiv in November 2013 \u2013 called \"Maidan\" or \"Euromaidan\" \u2013 were not provoked from outside but were a result of the Ukrainian people's frustration with former President Yanukovych's last-minute policy U-turn, when after seven years of negotiations, he refused to sign the EU\u2013Ukraine Association Agreement. More cases on this topic here. The claim that NATO or the US was planning to base ships and missiles in Crimea is fiction. The idea has never been proposed, suggested or discussed within NATO. In the\u00a0Statement\u00a0by the North Atlantic Council on Crimea on 18 March 2019, NATO condemned Russia's ongoing and wide-ranging military build-up in Crimea, and expressed concern by Russia's efforts and stated plans for a further military build-up in the Black Sea region. See a similar case: After the Maidan, Crimea was supposed to become a NATO or US naval base.",

In addition to official meetings, he held informal meetings with Ukrainian activists. During a meeting with Crimean representatives, the former deputy head of the Ministry of Information Policy of Ukraine, the representative of the Crimean Tatar people Emine Dzheppar, asked the White House to keep annexed Crimea insight of US foreign policy and categorically denies that Pompeo said anything about the impossibility of returning Crimea to Ukraine. The US Embassy in Ukraine also denied that Pompeo mentioned anything about Crimea being a lost cause.\u00a0 Moreover, at a press briefing with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Pompeo emphasised that the United States of America will never recognise the annexation of Crimea by Russia. Pompeo also recalled that the United States fully supports the Crimea Declaration of 2018 on the non-recognition of the Russian annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. Read similar cases that Crimea never belonged to Ukraine and that Crimea is now recognised as an integral part of Russia.",

Find similar cases here. Exercise Defender-Europe 2020 is the deployment of a division-size combat-credible force from the United States to Europe, the drawing of equipment and the movement of personnel and equipment across the theatre to various training areas. The aim of the exercises is to increase strategic readiness and interoperability by exercising the U.S. military\u2019s ability to rapidly deploy a large combat-credible force and equipment from the United States to Europe; and alongside its allies and partners, quickly respond to a potential crisis. \"The joint, multinational training exercise is scheduled to take place from April to May 2020, with personnel and equipment movements occurring from February through July 2020. The exercise supports objectives defined by NATO to build readiness within the alliance and deter potential adversaries. Approximately 37,000 U.S., allied, and partner nation service members are expected to participate with roughly 20,000 Soldiers deploying from the U.S,\" is noted on the official web site of the exercises. Eighteen countries are expected to participate, with exercise activities occurring across 10 countries. More details about the exercise can be found here. At a press conference in Berlin on January 14, 2020, the Deputy Commander of the US Armed Forces in Europe, General Andrew Rawling, announced that the Defender 2020 is not directed against Russia or against another country: \"These manoeuvres are not related to any particular country. In this, they differ from past exercises of the Cold War. It is a question of defence in general under various crisis scenarios.",

Official Swedish statistics show that the crime rate in Sweden is relatively low and at a stable level. Sweden is regularly targeted by pro-Kremlin disinformation efforts, displaying a narrative on the country \"descending into chaos\", due to migration and \"perversions\".",

According to various sources, several dozen strains of the coronavirus have been recorded in the world,\u00a0seven of which\u00a0present varying degrees of danger to humans. First and foremost, these types of viruses bring on respiratory disease.\u00a0Viruses are dangerous because they can be transmitted by humans and animals and because they mutate so quickly. In response to the outbreak of the coronavirus, the Chinese authorities have placed more than a dozen cities under quarantine. The\u00a0World Health Organisation\u00a0is working with Chinese authorities and global experts to learn more about the virus. The virus \"2019-nCoV\u201d comes from a family of viruses that include the common cold, and viruses such as\u00a0SARS\u00a0and\u00a0MERS. There is no evidence to suggest it was developed or disseminated artificially. The current coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\u00a0was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in central China and has been rapidly spreading with new cases being reported\u00a0in the Asia-Pacific region as well as Europe, North America and the Middle East.",

In late December 2019, Podgorica adopted officially a law on secularisation of church property. Churches built before 1918 are declared state property. That is the bulk of the churches of Montenegro. The US and the Patriarch of Constantinople is interest in the realisation of this law. The Americans are putting pressure upon the Serbian patriarchate, demanding that it denounces the support of the Moscow Patriarchy and recognise the so-called Orthodox Church of Ukraine, established in 2018.",

The claim that Poland was \u201can ally of Nazi Germany\u201d goes against all available historical documents. Before WWII, Poland had tense political relations with Nazi Germany, which expressed open territorial claims on Poland (revision of the status of the\u00a0Free City of Danzig\u00a0and control over the \u201cPolish Corridor\u201d). Despite intense political pressure from Hitler, Poland consistently refused to become part of the Nazi block. According to the pre-war plans of Hitler, Poland was supposed to be part of the \u201cliving space\u201d/\u00a0Lebensraum for the Third Reich, a large part of its territory was planned to be incorporated into the German state and millions of Poles and Polish Jews were supposed to be exterminated. Read similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland such as\u00a0Poland posed a military threat to the USSR in 1938-1939,\u00a0Nazi Germany considered Poland its best ally,\u00a0If Poland realized a rational policy in 1939, Moscow would have had a different approach towards it\u00a0and\u00a0Poland re-writes the history of the Warsaw uprising accusing the USSR of its failure.",

Moreover, the pact did not include any agreements on advanced political, economic and military relations between Poland and Germany.

After Putin\u2019s statements about the anti-Semitic attitudes of the pre-war Polish ambassador to Berlin, the issue of Putin\u2019s visit to the Auschwitz ceremony automatically disappeared. Russia was represented at this event by Ambassador Andreyev. In the historical context, it looked very strange; for example, the Dutch delegation at the Auschwitz ceremony was represented by three high-level officials (Prime Minister, King and the Queen). Meanwhile, unlike the USSR, the Netherlands did not play any major role in the fight against Nazism.",

According to the statement\u00a0of Krzysztof Szczerski, Chief of the Cabinet of the Polish President, the invitations for the Auschwitz commemoration events were issued by the\u00a0Auschwitz Museum, not by the Polish authorities. The governments of each invited country (including Russia) decide on what political level they will be represented during the event. At the ceremony Russian delegation\u00a0was chaired by Russian Ambassador to Poland Sergey Andreyev. This means that it was a\u00a0decision\u00a0by President Putin not to come to the Auschwitz liberation anniversary \u2013 Russia had a change to send to the Auschwitz ceremony any high-ranking officials. See other disinformation messages regarding Poland and the Holocaust such as Poland tries to impose its vision of the Holocaust on the West\u00a0and\u00a0Poland created a fertile ground for Holocaust because of its pre-war anti-Semitism. As for the commemoration of the anniversary of the World War II outbreak in September 2019, President Putin was indeed not invited. According to the Polish authorities, the reason for not inviting Russian president had to do with Russian aggression on Ukraine. For more information, see\u00a0here\u00a0and here.",

The\u00a0Munich Agreement (September 30, 1938), indeed, permitted the German annexation of the Sudetenland in western Czechoslovakia. The policy of appeasement towards Adolf Hitler was heavily criticised in Europe and proved to be a disastrous move. World War II began in Europe one year later, on 1 September 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. The signing of the\u00a0Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact\u00a0was a mutual decision of two totalitarian regimes (Nazi Germany\u00a0and the\u00a0Stalinist USSR) aimed at the division of Eastern and Central Europe between these two powers. It is a well-known fact\u00a0that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the\u00a0Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of WWII.

The primary source, Ukrainian edition Novoye Vremya spread the information mistakenly, but later it updated the report to clarify the issue. Russian online media did not make any corrections to the materials shared from Novoye Vremya. According to Unian, Emine Dzhaparova, a participant in the meeting with U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, in Kyiv, said that the Crimean issue was raised at the meeting and Pompeo\u2019s position on this issue is very clear. Dzhaparova posted on her official Facebook page that \u201cRussian media have 'grabbed' the incorrect material of NV on the meeting with Pompeo and keep on stuffing the info space with the front-page headlines of their own desirable 'truth'.\u201d For similar cases accusing the US for attempting to undermine Ukraine and Crimea, see here and here.",

Since 2013 China has attempted to go away from the strategy imposed by the West, namely the confrontation with Russia. The West boosted China with the aim to throw it against Russia. To constrain China, thanks to the hysteria around coronavirus and growing Sinophobia, soon the West will start blocking Chinese trade routes and make the presence of Chinese business in Europe more problematic.",

The claim that the West has been pushing China to wage war against Russia which Beijing ultimately refused to do, is groundless. The virus migrated from animals to humans, and while the scientists continue to track its origins there is no evidence to suggest it has been made artificially. In response to the outbreak of the coronavirus, the Chinese authorities have placed more than a dozen cities under quarantine. The\u00a0World Health Organisation\u00a0is working with Chinese authorities and global experts to learn more about the virus.

The article also contains the recurrent disinformation message that accuses Poland of anti-Semitism. The claim that Poland was \u201can ally of Nazi Germany\u201d goes against all available historical documents. It is impossible to compare the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 with the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, as the former was a standard international agreement aimed at the mutual recognition of borders and a declaration that existing political conflicts would be solved through diplomatic tools. There is no historical evidence that this pact contained any secret protocols which assumed common aggressive actions of Germany and Poland against third parties. In the case of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, it is a\u00a0historical fact\u00a0that it contained the\u00a0Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Moreover, in 1934, the plans of Hitler were still unknown, so all European countries carried out normal diplomatic relations with Germany. By contrast, the secret protocols to the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact definitely provided for the division of the territories of other countries between Germany and the USSR. The Nazi-Soviet Pact enabled the German Fuhrer Adolf Hitler and the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin to start the war by assaulting their neighbours and to create the situation, where \u201cterritorial and political restructuring\u201d occurred, followed by the wide seizure of foreign territories and the elimination of independence in neighbouring countries. Read similar cases claiming that some European countries especially Poland, had conspired with Nazi Germany, that the German-Polish non-aggression pact of 1934 assumed the partition of the USSR, that the Nazi-Soviet Pact was a direct result of the Munich Agreements that sold out Czechoslovakia, that Poland was a Nazi ally, and that Warsaw colluded with Hitler to expel Polish Jews to Africa.",

            "content": "Recurring pro-Kremlin conspiracy theory painting the\u00a0White Helmets as terrorists and shifting blame for chemical attacks in Syria away from Damascus. The claim is made without evidence and follows the pattern of unsubstantiated accusations regarding the White Helmets' complicity in chemical attacks in Syria. Available evidence\u00a0on such attacks has yet to link a single incident to any other party than the Assad regime. The photo accompanying the Sputnik report is not a still image from the \"video\" in question. It was taken by the White Helmets in July 2019\u00a0and shows the aftermath of a Syrian government airstrike on the city of Ariha, Idlib province. The organisation posted no videos or any other information pertaining to chemical attacks in Syria since the emergence of this disinformation narrative, either on Twitter or on Facebook. The claim that the OPCW \"stopped short of apportioning blame\" for the Douma attack is manipulative. The chemical watchdog refrained from doing so not for lack evidence, but in the absence of formal powers at the time to blame any specific party for chemical attacks. In a November 2018 vote on the issue, Russia vehemently opposed the granting of such powers to the OPCW. For more information about the importance of the White Helmets in pro-Kremlin disinformation regarding the Syrian war, see\u00a0here,\u00a0here, and\u00a0here. See here for more pro-Kremlin disinformation claims about the OPCW.",

Defender Europe 2020 is an exercise of strategic defence and its target is to counter a \u201cRussian invasion\u201d. And since there are no hints that Moscow is attempting to ever invade Europe, it is clear that those exercises are anti-Russian by nature and are another planned provocation against Russia.",

These claims are part of a recurrent Kremlin-led narrative to portray NATO and Western armies as aggressive forces against Russia. This particular article is a translation from an op-ed in RT English, but while the original article mentioned \u201cwar against Russia role-plays\u201d in its headline, the version in NewsFront Spanish doubled down the narrative as \u201cwar against Russia\u201d.

Moreover, the report presented in 2019 by the Israeli Minister for Diaspora Relations, Naftali Bennett, states that \u201cthe anti-Semitic incidents in Ukraine were inspired by outsider forces hostile to Ukraine, aimed at discrediting Ukraine in the eyes of the global community\u201d (p. 72). In addition, the Pew Research Centre, according to the results of 2018, said that Ukraine has the lowest level of anti-Semitism - 5%. At the same time, this indicator in Armenia is 32%, in Lithuania - 23%, and in Romania - 22%. A 2018 study by the Kantor Centre at Tel Aviv University notes that \u201cThe countries with the highest number of [violent anti-Semitic] cases are the US (over 100 cases), the UK (68), France and Germany (35 each) [...] It should be noted that the numbers of cases in Eastern Europe have been much lower, for a number of years, in comparison to Western Europe, going down from 12 in Ukraine to a few in the other countries.\u201d (p.5) See similar cases such as Ukraine's heroes are all anti-Semites and Nazi's took over Ukraine with a coup.",

During the Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on 22 January 2020, Ukrainian Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk announced that German national rail operator Deutsche Bahn had signed a memorandum of cooperation with the Ukrainian Ministry of Infrastructure.

The USSR also started negotiations with Germany in parallel and on 23 August 1939 signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop (Stalin-Hitler) pact. The agreement was accompanied by a secret supplementary protocol, which divided territories of Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland into German and Soviet \"spheres of influence\". The pact had the most tragic consequences for European nations and the world. What followed was the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the USSR in September 1939, followed by the further carving up of Europe. The Kremlin denied the existence of the secret protocol to the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact up until 1989.",

However,\u00a0in resolution N2317, the Assembly noted that the Russian Federation should \"address the problem of violence against journalists, including murders, physical attacks and threats, arrests, imprisonment, on-line harassment\", \"prevent police violence against journalists, as has happened during July-August 2019 demonstrations in Moscow\" and \"review the terms of reference of the Russian federal media regulator, Roskomnadzor, to limit its excessive power in the monitoring and censorship of the media, including on-line media; the blocking of independent media outlets without any warning or explanation, as recently happened to the Fergana news website, is an action amounting to censorship that is incompatible with the freedom of the media\".

A few months ago, the head of Microsoft held an exercise called Event 201, which simulated an outbreak of a new virus that killed 65 million people in 18 months. The idea of the teachings is simple \u2013 globalization in the name of salvation. Well-known pharmaceutical giants and the Pentagon representatives took part in this exercise. The timing of the exercise cannot be a coincidence: when the exercises were conducted, the coronavirus did not exist. It should either be Nostradamus, or a person who created it [the virus]. Therefore, these exercises directly confirm Gates\u2019s involvement in this problem.",

            "content": "The peace treaty between the Republic of Estonia and Soviet Russia was signed on 2 February 1920, and it ended the Estonian War of Independence that had lasted for nearly a year and a half. According to the treaty, Russia\u00a0recognised Estonian independence de jure, renouncing voluntarily \u201cfor ever all rights of sovereignty formerly held by Russia over the Estonian people and territory\u201d. It also established Estonia\u2019s eastern border. To this day the section 122 of the constitution of Estonia reads: \"The land border of Estonia is determined by the Tartu Peace Treaty of 2 February 1920 and by other international border agreements.\" Thus Estonia regards the Tartu Peace Treaty very much in effect.  \"Attempts by Russia to falsify history by denying the annexation of Estonia constitutes vindication of the policy of spheres of influence and the violence of totalitarian regimes and is condemned by the Republic of Estonia,\" Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu said. Minister Reinsalu also remarked that the Tartu Treaty is considered valid to this day, and is linked to the concepts of the illegal annexation of Estonia and the restoration of the country\u2019s sovereignty. The claim about outside stimulation to maintain tensions between Moscow and Tallinn is a great example of \"under the control of\" narrative hinting Estonia is not really sovereign. Similar examples include Americans need to keep the Europeans under their tight control, and Ukraine has been under systematic external control. In the context of Soviet Russia recognizing the independence of the Republic of Estonia in perpetuity, it should also be noted that in 1944 Estonia did not join the Soviet Union but was rather invaded, occupied and annexed. Estonia regained independence in 1991, and Russian troops finally withdrew from Estonia in 1994.",

            "content": "Conspiracy theory. This is a pro-Kremlin narrative about the coronavirus. The World Health Organisation is still working with Chinese authorities and global experts to learn more about the virus. The virus \"2019-nCoV\u201d comes from a family of viruses that include the common cold, and viruses such as SARS\u00a0and\u00a0MERS. There is no evidence to suggest it was developed artificially as a weapon of mass destruction. This\u00a0narrative\u00a0was blown out of proportion later on after it was echoed by the\u00a0Russian Ministry of Health.

            "content": "This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Council of Europe, attempting to undermine the institution, as well as a recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about the West's deliberate anti-Russian activities, Russophobia and double standards. The Council of Europe is an international organisation whose stated aim is to uphold human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in Europe. The Council of Europe is not \"anti\" any country, nor does the PACE offend anyone. PACE resolutions aim at resolving existing problems and cannot be considered as steps against the country concerned. During the PACE winter session, the executive director of Russia Today and editor-in-chief of Sputnik Estonia claimed without evidence that there is no freedom of speech in Estonia, but rather total censorship. However,\u00a0in resolution N2317, the Assembly noted that in fact the Russian Federation should \"address the problem of violence against journalists, including murders, physical attacks and threats, arrests, imprisonment, on-line harassment\", \"prevent police violence against journalists, as has happened during July-August 2019 demonstrations in Moscow\" and \"review the terms of reference of the Russian federal media regulator, Roskomnadzor, to limit its excessive power in the monitoring and censorship of the media, including on-line media; the blocking of independent media outlets without any warning or explanation, as recently happened to the Fergana news website, is an action amounting to censorship that is incompatible with the freedom of the media\". See similar cases claiming that the West practices double standards when dealing with Russia, that PACE is a propagandistic assembly that deals with Russophobia at all levels, that the Council of Europe is a completely meaningless and absolutely anti-Russian organisation, and that the Council of Europe is Russophobic and rulings from the Strasbourg Court are anti-Russian.",

CONIFA was founded in 2013 to oversee international competitions among the non-FIFA affiliated associations in the world. The so-called \"Donetsk People's Republic\" and \"Luhansk People's Republic\" are among the members of CONIFA. Meanwhile, organisers emphasise the non-political role of the competition. In Europe, there are two official football structures that are authorised to hold or give the right to host world and continental championships. They are FIFA and UEFA. At the moment, 206 officially recognised states are members of FIFA, which have the right to hold and fight for participation in world and continental championships. Neither FIFA nor UEFA recognises CONIFA nor its championship. Some other countries, not only Ukraine, whose unrecognised territories are involved in the CONIFA tournament, are protesting against this tournament as well. For example, Abkhazia, an unrecognised republic, which is internationally considered to be part of Georgia, is one of the participants in the tournament. It also held this competition in 2016, and the Georgian authorities spoke about the illegality of CONIFA, especially since the participants came to Abkhazia through Russia, which is illegal under Georgian law. Azerbaijan also opposes CONIFA.",

In a new Belarus, which the West is planning to build on the ruins of the Union State of Belarus and Russia, the West does not need Alexander Lukashenko in any status. The US will not behave as the Kremlin, which tolerates Lukashenko\u2019s demarches and does not interfere in Belarus\u2019 domestic affairs. An appointment of US ambassador to Belarus means that the embassy will soon start reviewing the candidates to Belarus\u2019 presidential position. Given the specifics of Belarus, Lukashenko may be overthrown not through the Maidan, but in a coup. In case someone suddenly backs up and attempts to save Belarus from turning into yet another US colony, the West may bring hundreds of Belarusian nationals who fought in Donbas on Kyiv\u2019s side. Following the power change in Belarus, so-called peacekeeping forces from Poland or the Baltic states may enter and replace the Russian military in Belarus.",

            "content": "This is a conspiracy theory which is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about Western attempts to organise a colour revolution in Belarus\u00a0and to disrupt Belarusian-Russian relations. The US and other Western countries do not have plans to organize a forceful power change in Belarus or to send any peacekeeping forces from Poland or the Baltic states. Belarusian authorities expelled US ambassador in 2008 in response to US sanctions introduced for the rigged presidential elections in Belarus and poor human rights record. The sides announced their plans to restore ambassadors during the US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale' s visit to Minsk in September 2019. This intention was confirmed during US State Secretary Mike Pompeo visit to Minsk on 1 February 2020. See earlier disinformation cases alleging that the West dreams of tearing Belarus apart from Russia and to organise a Ukraine-like scenario, that Belarusian opposition leader Andrei Sannikau prepares a coup with US military assistance, and that pro-Western Belarusian opposition prepares a revolution with the assistance of armed Ukrainian nationalists.",

The exercise is a mistake, the West is in a phase where it has to approach Russia because it needs Russia to solve the global problems in the Middle East and in North Africa. These problems are much more acute than the problems in Ukraine. But unfortunately, a large part of the German leadership elite today is of the opinion that everything possible must be done to show solidarity with the Poles and the Balts.",

Rohling emphasises that the aim of the exercise is not to target any country, but rather to test strategic readiness and how to react to a crisis. Exercise Defender-Europe 2020 is the deployment of a division-size combat-credible force from the United States to Europe, the drawing of equipment and the movement of personnel and equipment across the Atlantic to various training areas in Europe, like Germany and Poland. With US Defender Europe 2020, the 18 participating NATO-countries are therefore practising procedures to ensure and demonstrate the ability to relocate and also to confirm the alliance's commitment to supporting and, in particular, to show the United States' commitment to Europe's security. There are 37,000 participants - of which up to 20,000 from the USA are to be relocated to Europe - and takes place from January to May 2020. U.S. service members will then spread out across the region to establish intermediate staging bases with multinational forces and participate in various annual exercises.

            "content": "A number of conspiracy theories that are only linked by the fact that they are \"separate\" incidents, and echos some recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation especially about\u00a0China coronavirus. The narratives also resemble a recurring conspiracy theory about the Lugar Lab in Georgia. The claims about Canadian involvement in the coronavirus spread appear to be based on a mischaracterization of August 2019 reports about a transfer\u00a0of Ebola and Nipah viruses from a Canadian lab to Beijing, and an apparently\u00a0separate issue\u00a0involving two Chinese researchers at Canada\u2019s\u00a0National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg, in the central province of Manitoba. Read further debunking by the AFP Fact Check. As for the US participation in the Military World Games and its connection with the coronavirus, there is no evidence to prove this claim.\u00a0There were 9,308 athletes from 109 countries that have registered to participate in 2019 Military World Games held between October 18-27. While the incubation period of 2019-nCoV, also known as coronavirus, is believed to vary from as few as 2 days to as long as 14 days after the exposure, according to the CDC. This is based on what has been seen previously as the incubation period of MERS viruses. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the first reported unusual cluster of\u00a0pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan was recorded on 31 December 2019, when Chinese authorities confirmed they were investigating 27 cases of viral pneumonia, which is 65 days after the closing ceremony of the Military World Games.",

            "content": "No evidence given. This is a conspiracy theory, consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about\u00a0Russophobia and Western belligerence towards Russia. Europe does not want to deliberately weaken or destroy Russia as claimed by some Russian propagandists. European foreign policy is built on the principles of international law. Russia was one of the \"key partners\" of the EU until March 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea. This, together with the Russia-backed war in the Eastern Ukraine, has severely affected bilateral relations. As a result, some of the policy dialogues and mechanisms of cooperation are frozen. Since March 2014, the EU has progressively imposed restrictive measures against Russia, in response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and the deliberate destabilisation of Ukraine. Russia remains a member of the Council of Europe and OSCE and can therefore influence the overall European political agenda. Read similar disinformation narratives alleging that Europe and the US are trying to destabilise Russia such as The European Parliament resolution on the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact is aimed at the demonisation of Russia, Ukraine and Georgia are Western tools against Russia, \"Russian threat\" is only a pretext to station NATO military contingents near Russian borders.",

            "content": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the US and about the coronavirus. The claim that the United States has patented and owns the coronavirus goes back to viral incorrect claims that the virus, along with its vaccine is owned by the Pirbright Institute (a research institute in the UK), was funded by the American Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The institute works to prevent viral diseases of livestock. The Pirbright Institute clarified that they don\u2019t work with human coronaviruses\u00a0and that a patent that they hold is unrelated to the current coronavirus linked to Wuhan. The patent that the story links to - No. 10,130,701 - is for a mutated form of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a different coronavirus that infects poultry, but not people. That patent was filed by the\u00a0Pirbright Institute, but not funded by the Gates Foundation, and the mutations were created to weaken the virus so that it could be used as a vaccine to protect chickens from IBV. Matthew Frieman, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Maryland,\u00a0told FactCheck.org that the patent has nothing to do with the new 2019-nCoV virus. The American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention explains that the name of new coronavirus comes from the crown, or corona-like appearance of infective viruses when seen under a microscope. The CDC\u00a0told the Associated Press in 2003 that the agency was claiming ownership of a patent related to a virus that causes SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease that spread to dozens of countries in 2003, in result of which more than 8,000 people got ill and 774 people died), in order to ensure access and to prevent others from controlling the technology.",

The statement followed the resolution of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on the progress of the Assembly's monitoring procedure which stated concerns over Russia on condition of human rights and rule of law, borderisation and creeping annexation of Georgian regions, implementation of Minsk agreements and cooperation over the downing of the MH17 flight. Kremlin narratives on Minsk agreement claim that Russia is not part of the conflict in Donbas and that Russia has nothing to do with the war in eastern Ukraine. The European Union stated in July 2014 that \"arms and fighters continue flowing into Ukraine from the Russian Federation\".\u00a0 At the NATO Summit in Wales in September 2014, NATO leaders condemned in the strongest terms Russia\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine and demanded Russia to stop and withdraw its forces from Ukraine and from the country\u2019s border. NATO leaders also demanded Russia comply with international law and its international obligations and responsibilities; refrain from aggressive actions against Ukraine; halt the flow of weapons, equipment, people and money across the border to the separatists; and stop fomenting tension along and across the Ukrainian border. In 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u00a0admitted Russia's military presence in Ukraine. Similar disinformation cases on Minsk agreements can be found here and here. See here and here for background information about EU policy on Ukraine.",

            "content": "Russian officials were angered by PACE Resolution No. 2325, which concerns countries under the control of the Parliamentary Assembly. Among other things, the document contains criticisms of Russia's anti-democratic actions both domestically and in relation to other countries. The resolution says that \u201cRussia is reinforcing the negative tendencies of democracy, the rule of law and human rights\u201d, continues to establish \u201cborders\u201d and carries\u00a0out the \u201ccreeping annexation of the Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia\u201d, and also continues the \u201cillegal annexation of Crimea and military aggression in the east of Ukraine.\u201d In addition, the document contains a number of requirements for Russia: \u201cto reverse its illegal annexation of Crimea\u201d. Also, among the PACE requirements for Russia, there are clauses on \u201cfully implementing the Minsk agreements to which the Russian Federation is a party and to end its military intervention in, and support for, illegally armed formations in Eastern Ukraine\u201d and \u201cunconditionally and fully co-operate with the joint investigation team and the Dutch prosecution service in bringing those responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 to justice.\u201d The narratives that Russia supposedly \u201cis not a part of the conflict\u201d and \u201cshould not implement the Minsk agreements\u201d remain the most popular disinformation narratives, along with the narrative of \u201creunification of Crimea and Russia\u201d. The Kremlin is constantly trying to deny its aggression against Ukraine, despite the huge array of documents confirming Russia's intervention in Ukraine\u2019s internal affairs. Moreover, independent researchers have proven Russia's involvement in the attack on the Malaysian Boeing MH17, it is Russia that is responsible for deploying the BUK anti-aircraft missile system, which was used to destroy a civilian aircraft, in the occupied part of Donbas. The findings of international experts were officially agreed in the Netherlands, Australia, the United States, G7 countries, the EU and NATO.",

Vaccines are supported by extensive scientific research. They are the main tool for primary prevention of disease and one of the most cost-effective public health measures available, saving millions of people from illness, disability and death each year. Immunisation through vaccination is the best defence we have against serious, preventable, and sometimes deadly contagious diseases. Thanks to widespread vaccination, smallpox has been eradicated, Europe made polio-free, and many other diseases almost eliminated. Effective and safe vaccines, which protect against a number of serious diseases, are available and many promising new vaccines are being developed. See more information on vaccines here. The World Health Organisation has a page devoted to anti-vaccine mythbusting here. For similar cases, see here.",

A special team, known as the\u00a0Joint Investigation Team (JIT), was established to conduct the criminal investigation\u00a0of the downing of the Malaysian Airlines flight MH17. The JIT comprises officials from the Dutch Public Prosecution Service and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. The JIT has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy. At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was taken\u00a0back to the Russian Federation.\u00a0The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT), has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17, originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. See previous disinformation narratives alleging that MH17 was a false flag attack, planned by British and Ukrainian security agencies, that Ukraine conceals evidence confirming its guilt, while Ukrainian secret service manipulated a sound recording in the MH17 investigation.",

Its purpose is to protect the member states. NATO's exercises and military deployments in the Black Sea are not directed against Russia or any other country. NATO has reached out to Russia consistently, transparently and publicly over the past 29 years. NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia. Every sovereign nation has the right to choose its own security arrangements. This is a fundamental principle of European security, one that Russia has also subscribed to, and should respect. NATO enlargement has brought more stability and prosperity to Europe, including Russia. In 2014 at NATO Wales Summit the alliance agreed to offer Georgia a substantial package of assistance to strengthen Georgia's defence and interoperability capabilities with the Alliance. In August 2015, a NATO-Georgian Joint Training and Evaluation Centre was inaugurated in Krtsanisi to contribute to the training and interoperability of Georgian and Alliance personnel. The Training Centre is not directed against Russia but contributes to stability by making Georgia's armed forces more professional, and by reinforcing the democratic controls over them. The main goal of all the training of the Georgian military with NATO experts is to increase the country's defence capability. Read more about NATO-Georgia relations here.

In response to the outbreak of the coronavirus, the Chinese authorities have placed more than a dozen cities under quarantine. The\u00a0World Health Organisation is working with Chinese authorities and global experts to learn more about the virus. On the basis of the full genome of the virus, it was concluded that 2019-nCoV is a beta-coronavirus that comes from a family of viruses that include the common cold and other viruses such as SARS\u00a0and\u00a0MERS. These kind of viruses are common in different species of animals and sometimes can affect people. There is no evidence to suggest it was developed artificially as a weapon of mass destruction. The conspiracy theory also repeats the recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the\u00a0Lugar Lab in Tbilisi, Georgia.

The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine has been the cornerstone of Russian disinformation about the country since the very beginning of the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests, when it was used to discredit the pro-European popular uprising in Kyiv and, subsequently, the broader pro-Western shift in Ukraine's foreign policy. Far-right groups enjoyed a\u00a0very limited presence during the Euromaidan itself and had poor results in the 2014 presidential\u00a0and\u00a0parliamentary elections. In the 2019 election, far-right candidates fell short\u00a0of the 5% minimum guaranteeing entry into parliament.

You can see other examples of disinformation about US plans and actions worldwide, such as its attempts to cause a massive African migration wave to Europe, its experiments on people in Georgia, its promotion of jihadist terrorism and colour revolutions, its preparations for war with Russia or its alleged responsibility in the China coronavirus outbreak. The US government has indeed imposed new visa restrictions on a total of six more countries, including Nigeria, that failed to meet minimum security requirements for verifying travelers' identities and whether individuals posed a national security threat. According to the AFP Factcheck, a wave of misinformation hit Nigeria following this decision. Regardless of these restrictions, the US has maintained good relations with Nigeria since its independence from the United Kingdom in 1960. The country is the United States\u2019 second-largest trading partner in Africa and the third-largest beneficiary of U.S. foreign direct investment on the continent. The US is the largest foreign investor in Nigeria. The US provided almost 658,5 million dollars in assistance in 2019, and cooperation includes military training and counterterrorism advisory. Nigerians also comprise the largest African diaspora group in the United States, which has no interest in destabilising Nigeria or blocking its development.",

The UK and the United States were also against Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and chose to retaliate against the Third Reich. The UK declared war on the Nazi regime as a result of German refusal to remove troops from neutral Belgium. Prior to the German invasion, the United Kingdom had signed the Treaty of London (1839) which guaranteed British and French defence of Belgium sovereignty. And in\u00a01941, Germany declared war on the United States, bringing America, which had been neutral, into the European conflict, in a response to what was claimed to be a series of provocations by Washington, which followed the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the United States declaration of war against the Japanese Empire. Furthermore,\u00a0the European Parliament stresses the fact that WWII was an immediate result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, where Hitler and Stalin agreed to divide Poland. Just a week after the signing of the Pact, the German attack on Poland started World War II. Two weeks later, Soviet troops entered Polish territory. Read similar cases about the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact\u00a0here,\u00a0here, here, here\u00a0and\u00a0here. Read other cases alleging that Allied Forces were close to Hitler: Europe signed alliances with Hitler but speaks only about Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and UK and France allowed Hitler to revive a strong army.",

It is impossible to compare the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 with the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact as the former was a standard international agreement aimed at the mutual recognition of borders and a declaration that existing political contradictions would be solved through diplomatic tools. There is no historical evidence that this pact contained any secret protocols, which assumed common aggressive actions of Germany and Poland against the USSR or other countries. Moreover, the pact did not include any agreements on advanced political, economic and military relations between Poland and Germany. Secondly, in 1934, the plans of Hitler were still unknown, so all European countries carried out normal diplomatic relations with Germany. Read similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland such as Poland posed a military threat to the USSR in 1938-1939,\u00a0Nazi Germany considered Poland its best ally, if Poland realised a rational policy in 1939, Moscow would have had a different approach towards it\u00a0and\u00a0Poland re-writes the history of the Warsaw uprising accusing the USSR of its failure.",

            "content": "Conspiracy theory, suggesting that pro-Western political parties are led by George Soros in the shadow. The Soros Foundation has been working in Moldova since 1992, financing and promoting programs and activities in areas such as media, justice and human rights, good governance, and public health with the aim to support the development of an open society. Since then, dozens of Moldovan specialists have been employed by the foundation or collaborated in its programs. Some deputies from the \"Party of Action and Solidarity\", a pro-Western and anti-corruption party, led by Maia Sandu, and two former ministers from the former government led by her, have previously participated in the Soros Foundation's programs, as can be seen, for example, in the Soros Foundation's 2008 report. The former Minister of Justice, Olesea Stamate, was the director of the Public Administration and Good Governance program, and the former Minister of Education, Liliana Nicol\u0103escu-Onofrei, was the director of a project funded by the Soros Moldova Foundation, from the position of manager of the Educational Center Pro Didactica, which is a state institution. This doesn't, however, mean that \"Party of Action and Solidarity\" is a political branch of the Soros Foundation in Moldova. The creation of movement \"In PAS with Maia Sandu\" was announced by Maia Sandu, who was until July 2015 Minister of Education, on December 23, 2015. At the Party's Congress on July 25, 2016, the movement was transformed into the Party of Action and Solidarity. The party was constituted on grounds of voluntary association of the citizens and is a liberal centre-right party, member of the European People\u2019s Party family. Read similar cases alleging that Moldova\u2019s former Government served the interests of George Soros\u00a0and that Soros controls Zelenskyy and Armenian authorities.",

By signing the non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany in August 1939, the Soviet Union became complicit in the breakout of WWII. Following the conclusion of the agreement, the two dictatorships would remain allies for the next 22 months. The deal was accompanied by a secret supplementary protocol\u00a0on the delimitation of areas of mutual interest in Eastern Europe. In particular, Hitler and Stalin agreed to divide Poland. The agreement also indicated that the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, as well as Bessarabia and Finland, also belonged to the respective areas of interest of Germany and the USSR. A mere week after the pact's signing, Germany attacked Poland and started World War II. On 17 September, Soviet troops invaded Polish territory from the east. See here for expert commentary on Soviet/Russian myth-making around WWII, including efforts to diminish the geopolitical role and scope of the Nazi-Soviet pact.",

            "content": "This message is a recurring pro-Kremlin historical revisionist narrative and an attempt to erode the disastrous historical role of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact by stating that Poland was a Nazi ally, so it should blame itself. While it is true that Hitler organized a religious service after Pi\u0142sudski's death, and while it is also true that the latter's rule was authoritarian, none of this is evidence that there was an alliance between Poland and Nazi Germany. Before WWII, Poland had tense political relations with Nazi Germany, which expressed open territorial claims to Poland (revision of the status of the Free City of Danzig\u00a0and control over the \u201cPolish Corridor\u201d). Despite intense political pressure from Hitler, Poland consistently refused to become part of the Nazi block. After Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, Pi\u0142sudski was only compelled to accept Hitler\u2019s suggestion of a 10-year German-Polish non-aggression agreement signed in 1934. To show that this was not a sign of alliance with Hitler, Poland prolonged the existing non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union until December 31, 1945. Hitler repeatedly sought a German-Polish alliance against the Soviet Union, but Pi\u0142sudski had consistently denied such offer; he also declined to meet with Hitler. Pi\u0142sudski's objective was to gain time, believing that Poland should be ready to fight Nazi Germany when the necessity arose. Those were the last instructions he gave to his confidants before his death in 1935. Pi\u0142sudski was also renowned for his tolerance towards religious minorities, particularly towards the Jews. Read similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland - Poland posed a military threat to the USSR in 1938-1939, Nazi Germany considered Poland its best ally, If Poland realized a rational policy in 1939, Moscow would have had a different approach towards it and Poland re-writes the history of the Warsaw uprising accusing the USSR of its failure.",

            "content": "Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative denying Moscow's interference in Western democratic processes. The independent research, media investigations and parliamentary inquiries point out to evidence linking Russian state actors with interference in various electoral processes, including the Brexit vote, in the 2017 French Presidential elections, in the 2017 German Parliamentary elections, in the 2016 constitutional referendum in Italy and in the Dutch referendum on the EU\u2019s Association Agreement with Ukraine. Russian state efforts to affect the outcome of the Brexit vote are well-documented in parliamentary inquiries, think-tank reports and news reports. For instance, Russian interference in the French elections included attacks aimed at discrediting the then-presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron. Apart from biased reporting in the pro-Kremlin media, it included a made-up story about Macron's offshore accounts (the so-called MacronGate) and a hack-and-leak operation. According to the Insider\u00a0and\u00a0Mediapart, the hacking was perpetrated by\u00a0the same GRU unit\u00a0responsible for the hacking of the Democrats' servers in the US. For more information, see EU vs Disinfo analysis\u00a0\u201cTackling disinformation \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise\". Before the September 2017 German Parliamentary elections, the German editions of RT and Sputnik especially published vast numbers of anti-immigrant and anti-refugee stories that attacked Merkel and simultaneously promoted the far-right.\u00a0Pro-Kremlin bots amplified these stories on social networks. In Italy,\u00a0RT broadcast misleading news from\u00a0Rome\u00a0when the Italians were about to go to the polls and vote about constitutional reform. In the Netherlands,\u00a0Russia-linked trolls tried to influence the Dutch referendum on the EU\u2019s Association Agreement with Ukraine with a fake video containing a terror threat against the Dutch. For further background on Russian interference in various electoral processes in Europe see this article. Read our article on Russian election meddling in EU countries and in the US here. Read here similar cases claiming that there is no evidence of Russian meddling in the French and US elections and that there is no solid evidence to support the claim that Russia interfered in the 2016 Brexit referendum.",

The first narrative is that the US dictates and interferes in the internal politics of other countries. See similar cases claiming that the US and the EU govern Georgia, that strong Georgia is not in the interest of the West, and that the EU and US interfered in the domestic affairs of Ukraine. The second one is that the US destabilised Ukraine and created conflict with Russia. Read similar case claiming that the US does not want peace in Ukraine. And last but not least is the narrative claiming that the US is not a partner to Georgia. Between 2015 and 2019, the US allocated financial assistance to Georgia in the military field of 167 million USD. In 2019, the US allocated 35 million USD. In 2019, US Congress also passed the Georgia Support Act, a bipartisan bill that authorises sanctions against individuals involved in human rights violations in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. For a detailed overview of the fruits of US-Georgian strategic partnership, see here. Read similar cases claiming that NATO and the US do not fund any programmes in Georgia and that the West is only supporting Georgia with words.",

Anything close to the 10 billion figure can only be achieved by adding up viewership of all RT services in all languages. If we apply the same methodology to the BBC and CNN, they will comfortably pass the 10 billion views mark. As of 12/02/2020, the CNN News network has reached, at the very least, 11 billion views, and this does not include the non-news services owned by the CNN such as HBO. As for the BBC, the Youtube views of BBC news services in only 14 languages (out of 27) were at least 14 billion in 12/02/2020. This also does not include content such as sports and children's entertainment. It is also not clear whether RT has included its non-news outlets/Youtube channels (e.g. RT Sport) to the 10 billion figure. See a similar earlier case here.",

See earlier disinformation cases positing similar false dilemmas, like that Ukraine and Belarus face an unavoidable loss of sovereignty without remaining an integral part of Russia, that a Union State of Belarus and Russia is necessary to prevent Belarus'\u00a0impoverishment and degradation, and that becoming Russia's protectorate would save Belarus from forced Polonisation and economic devastation.",

The conspiracy theory also refers the recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about US military biological labs circling Russia.

            "content": "This claim tries to show sanctions against Russia, due to its illegal actions in Ukraine, as unfair persecution against Sputnik and its employees, and against media freedom in general. Estonia is on the 11th place of Reporters without Borders Press freedom index. Regarding censorship, Estonia has not blocked Sputnik Estonia's website and it is accessible. The Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu has emphasized that Estonia has not taken any measures against the portal's media content: \"They are financial sanctions aimed at economic activity. I believe it to be justified. We have notified the European Commission's Legal Service. European agencies have said in the Commission that steps taken by Estonia in exercising sanctions policy are warranted.\" The Article 2 of the Council Regulation (EU) No 269/2014 on the territorial integrity of Ukraine foresees freezing the assets of Dmitry Kiselyov, the Director-General of Rossija Segodnya. According to the articles of association of the company, the Director-General has the right to decide upon opening bank accounts and carry out invoicing. This corresponds to the condition \"having the right to use all or part of the assets of a legal person or entity\" in the EU Best Practices for the effective implementation of restrictive measures. Furthermore, claims that the Estonian laws only foresee asset freezing for people on an EU personal sanctions list is incorrect. \"This means that if Rossiya Segodnya, which is controlled by Dmitry Kiselyov, against whom sanctions have been imposed, has assets in Estonia, they must be frozen and access must not be given to funds or economic resources, that is provide services that would enable Rossiya Segodnya to do business. When it comes to Estonia, this prohibition applies to people operating in the territory of Estonia,\" head of anti-money laundering authority the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), Madis Reimand, said. The EU vs Disinfo team has found 49 different Sputnik websites from all over the world and 31 of them are in the Disinformation cases database, meaning those outlets have been reported publishing disinformation. Sputnik Estonia is represented in that database both in Estonian and in Russian languages. Similar cases about Sputnik Estonia can be read here.",

It's true that more than 2,500 monuments to the leaders of the communist totalitarian regime were dismantled in Ukraine alone during the decommunisation process. However, the vast majority of these were monuments to Lenin.\u00a0Ukrainian laws that control the decommunisation process, actually provide\u00a0for the protection and preservation of monuments and commemorative signs which are dedicated to the participants and victims of World War II 1939-1945. In Poland, the process of dismantling Soviet war monuments was accelerated by an amended \u201cdecommunisation\u201d law, which came into force in October 2017. It allows for the removal of up to 230 Soviet war monuments by local authorities within a year (after which remaining decisions will be made at regional level). As for Estonia, there is no \"massive demolition\" of monuments, and thus the disinformation narrative is groundless.",

At the same time, the infamous Munich Agreements have not been called after the names of the countries, which signed them. Many other non-aggression pacts and agreements signed by the European countries with Nazi Germany are perceived as regular international agreements, which did not have any importance for the war plans of Hitler. Meanwhile, with time, the German-Soviet non-aggression pact was proven to stand in one line with the Gleiwitz incident.",

            "content": "This message is part of the Kremlin\u2019s policy of\u00a0historical revisionism and an attempt to erode the disastrous historical role of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact by stating that other European countries signed various international agreements with Germany throughout 1930s. This message contains two disinformation claims \u2013 first of all, it perceives the calling of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact or Hitler-Stalin Pact as re-writing of history. Secondly, it suggests that the issue of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact is similar to the Gleiwitz incident, suggesting that there are many fake historical messages connected to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. It is impossible to compare the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with various agreements signed between Germany and other European countries throughout the 1930s. There is no historical evidence that these agreements contained any secret protocols, which assumed common aggressive actions of Germany and these countries against third parties. In the case of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, it is a proven historical fact\u00a0that it contained the\u00a0Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. That is why the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact has an extraordinary historical significance and it is often called by the historians as the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact or the Hitler-Stalin Pact. Secondly, it is impossible to compare the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact to the Gleiwitz incident \u2013 in case of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, its authenticity is not questioned by any sides. The Gleiwitz incident was an attempt of Hitler to stage a fake \u201cPolish\u201d attack on a German radio station in order to use this situation to invade Poland on September 1, 1939. Read similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland -\u00a0Poland posed a military threat to the USSR in 1938-1939,\u00a0Nazi Germany considered Poland its best ally,\u00a0If Poland realized a rational policy in 1939, Moscow would have had a different approach towards it\u00a0and\u00a0Poland re-writes the history of the Warsaw uprising accusing the USSR of its failure.",

            "content": "Sputnik was created by a Presidential decree with the aim to \u201creport on the state policy of Russia abroad\u201d. Numerous reports have described how top managers from all the large government-controlled outlets and some influential private media attend the weekly meetings where \"media managers receive guidelines that 'help' them not to overstep the Kremlin\u2019s so-called 'double white lines'.\" In all of the mentioned countries Sputnik and RT are being accused of spreading disinformation, violating copyrights, acting as a propaganda instrument. Here are some examples. In Estonia,\u00a0Sputnik is represented as a victim of unprecedented persecution. This kind of statements were debunked several times. Read here. The steps taken by Estonia are based on the Article 2 of the\u00a0Council\u00a0Regulation\u00a0(EU)\u00a0No\u00a0269/2014\u00a0on the territorial integrity of Ukraine that foresees freezing the assets of Dmitry Kiselyov, the Director-General of Rossija Segodnya. Lithuania is claimed to follow totalitarian laws, while Sputnik fights against intolerance. This came as in\u00a0mid-2019 a court in Vilnius ruled on blocking Sputnik Lithuania over copyright issues. Broadcasting service (LRT) approached the Radio and Telecommunications Committee and pointed out in a statement that Sputnik had illegally used LRT materials at least 1464 times in violation of copyrights. Lithuanian Sputnik had continued to distribute illegal material and had not reacted to repeated requests by the National Broadcasting service to stop the abuse of copyright infringement. In Latvia, in 2016, Latvia's domain registry shut the website of Sputnik Latvia after receiving a letter of concern from the Latvian Foreign Ministry, which drew attention to Sputnik's coverage of Ukraine and routine denial of the embattled nation's territorial integrity. In July 2019, Latvian authorities\u00a0blocked access to the online portal baltnews.lv, owned by Rossiya Segodnya. In the UK, in 2019, Russia's RT and Sputnik news agencies have been banned from attending a conference on media freedom in London for playing an \"active role in spreading disinformation\". In July of the same year, RT received a fine of 20,000 British pounds from the British regulator OFCOM \"for serious failures to comply with our broadcasting rules\". Talking about France, Sputnik insisted that French society needs high-quality journalism, that they deliver, that is why they are being harassed. In reality, the French broadcasting regulator, the Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019Audiovisuel (CSA), issued a warning to RT over a falsified report contesting the use of chemical weapons against Syrian civilians. Read about the situation with Sputnik and RT in France here. In Germany, it is claimed that there's a long-standing campaign to discredit Russian media. Government spokesman Steffen Seibert reacted to these accusations: \"Anyone who makes such absurd allegations in the world has little knowledge of Germany and little idea of freedom of the press,\" said government spokesman Seibert. German authorities emphasized, that the Russian government is expanding its media offerings in Germany in order to increase its influence. State enterprises are disguised as independent media to hide the fact that they belong to the Russian state. The most important of these are the Internet channel RT Deutsch and the Sputnik news agency. Europe has been working to expose Kremlin-backed propaganda campaigns for years. EU countries develope new legislative norms to counter disinformation flow. As European Commission Vice President V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 said: \"We are not seeking one magical instrument that will solve the problem,\" adding that the EU was looking to come up with cross-sector strategies to counter disinformation campaigns. The EU vs Disinfo team has found 49 different Sputnik websites from all over the world and 31 of them are in the Disinformation cases database, meaning those outlets have been reported publishing disinformation.",

According to this policy, the Russian official historiography is the only \u201ctrue\u201d way of interpretation of historical events for the countries of Eastern and Central Europe. The Polish initiative of the joint celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Warsaw is aimed at the commemoration of the Polish-Ukrainian efforts to stop the spread of Bolshevism in the region and protect its peoples from the Bolshevik terror and oppression. The Battle of Warsaw took place in August 1920 \u2013 it was a decisive battle of the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1921. This battle is often referred to in history as the \u201cmiracle on the Vistula\u201d as the Polish troops defeated much larger forces of the Bolshevik Russia. In April 1920, Poland and the Ukrainian People\u2019s Republic led by Symon Petliura formed a military alliance against the Bolshevik Russia, starting the joint Kyiv offensive aimed at pushing the Bolshevik forces out of Ukraine and improvement of the military positions of Poland in its war with Soviet Russia. Read similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland - It is thanks to Russia that Poland today exists as a country, Nazi Germany considered Poland its best ally, USSR was forced and reluctant to sign Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and the Polish legions of Pilsudski organized the Volyn tragedy.",

In World War II, Ukrainians had more victims than Great Britain, Canada, the United States and France combined. As a result of the war, over 700 cities and towns have been destroyed in Ukraine, with 10 million people left homeless. In addition, after the expulsion of the Nazis, about 500,000 people were repressed in Western Ukraine, and in 1944, 230,000 Crimean Tatars, Bulgarians, Armenians, and Greeks were deported. During World War II, Poland incurred the greatest human (for every 1000 inhabitants, it lost 220 people) and material losses. In 1946, during the International Reparations Conference in Paris, Poland's material losses were evaluated to be $16.9 billion. By signing the non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany in August 1939, the Soviet Union became complicit in the breakout of WWII. Following the conclusion of the agreement, the two dictatorships would remain allies for the next 22 months. The deal was accompanied by a\u00a0secret supplementary protocol on the delimitation of areas of mutual interest in Eastern Europe. In particular, Hitler and Stalin agreed to divide Poland. The agreement also indicated that the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, as well as Bessarabia and Finland, also belonged to the respective areas of interest of Germany and the USSR. A mere week after the pact's signing, Germany attacked Poland and started World War II. On 17 September, Soviet troops invaded Polish territory from the east. Read here an expert commentary on Soviet/Russian myth-making around WWII, including efforts to diminish the geopolitical role and scope of the Nazi-Soviet pact.",

They intentionally hype the threat and stir up a panic around the coronavirus, provoking a rise of Sinophobia. The virus must mostly have an artificial, man-made origin, and the way the Western media report about it points at this version. It is no coincidence that it came up at a time of second round of US-China negotiations and Brexit. The UK is becoming a new global actor, the new dawn of the British empire begins. Given that China proclaimed its own course in contradiction to West\u2019s, soon China may experience much larger economic problems stemming from the coronavirus infection. Chinese postal deliveries may be threatened which will bring colossal losses to China. The World Health Organization may also announce an epidemiological danger coming from China. This will result in further deterioration of China\u2019s international image, panicking at Chinese stock exchange markets, a blow to Chinese currency and possible political escalation.",

The virus migrated from animals to humans, and while the scientists continue to track its origins there is no evidence to suggest it has been made artificially. The claims implicating the UK and US media in stirring up panic and Western plans to harm Chinese postal deliveries and the country's economy through the World Health Organization are also groundless. In response to the outbreak of the coronavirus, the Chinese authorities have placed more than a dozen cities under quarantine. The\u00a0World Health Organisation\u00a0is working with Chinese authorities and global experts to learn more about the virus. The virus \"2019-nCoV\u201d comes from a family of viruses that include the common cold, and viruses such as\u00a0SARS\u00a0and\u00a0MERS. See previous pro-Kremlin disinformation cases, alleging that Bill Gates is sponsoring the coronavirus, that cancer, syphilis and Spanish flu are US biological weapons; and that the Rockefeller foundation owns the patent for Zika virus.",

According to the statement of Krzysztof Szczerski, Chief of the Cabinet of the Polish President, the invitations for the Auschwitz commemoration events were issued by the Auschwitz Museum, not by the Polish authorities. The Governments of each invited country (including Russia) decide on what political level they will be represented during the event. The Russian delegation took part in the ceremony of commemorations of the 75th Anniversary of the Auschwitz liberation \u2013 it was led by the Russian Ambassador Sergey Andreyev. This means that it was a decision by President Putin not to come to the Auschwitz liberation anniversary. A similar situation took place in 2015 when Russia accused Poland of not inviting the Russian delegation to the Auschwitz event in a proper way. Poland reacted to this accusation with a statement that every country invited by the Auschwitz Museum could be present on any political level. See other disinformation messages regarding Poland and the Holocaust such as Poland tries to impose its vision of the Holocaust on the West and Poland created a fertile ground for Holocaust because of its pre-war anti-Semitism.",

The claim is made without evidence and follows the pattern of unsubstantiated accusations regarding the White Helmets' complicity in chemical attacks in Syria. Available evidence\u00a0on such attacks has yet to link a single incident to any other party than the Assad regime. The White Helmets are a staple topic of pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives on the Syrian civil war, having already been accused of numerous other provocations and war crimes including\u00a0organ trafficking;\u00a0aiding terrorist organizations;\u00a0staging\u00a0and/or\u00a0perpetrating\u00a0chemical attacks, sometimes with the help of\u00a0Western intelligence agencies. A majority of these claims are unburdened by evidence and often rely on meaningless formulations such as \"according to information provided by X,\" \"there are reasons to assume,\" and so forth.

            "content": "This claim involves unfounded speculation, based on no supporting evidence, to smear the White Helmets, a humanitarian organisation and frequent target of pro-Kremlin disinformation, and Syrian opposition forces. This case involves a recurring pro-Kremlin narrative portraying the White Helmets as a Western-backed terrorist proxy and, implicitly, denying the responsibility of the Assad regime for chemical attacks perpetrated during the Syrian civil war. The UN-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism found Syria\u2019s government responsible for the April 2017 attack in Khan Shaykhun. On April 2018, Russia vetoed a US-drafted UN Security Council resolution that would have created a new inquiry to ascertain responsibility for chemical weapons attacks in Syria. In June\u00a0 2018, the OPCW members granted it the power to assign responsibility for chemical attacks. The UN Human Rights Council stated that Syrian government forces were responsible for the Khan Shaykhun attack. \u201cGovernment forces continued to deliberately target civilians, including through the use of chemical weapons against civilians in opposition-held areas. As part of an aerial campaign in northern Hama and southern Idlib, on 4 April the Syrian air force used sarin in Khan Sheikhoun, killing over 80 people, most of whom were women and children,\u201d says the report. Syrian government forces and their ally Russia continue to deny these facts. See here for more information about the disinformation campaign against the White Helmets. Read similar cases claiming that the White Helmets used chemical weapons in Syria in order to accuse the Assad government and that the White Helmets have close links to Al-Qaeda and falsify chemical attacks evidence.",
